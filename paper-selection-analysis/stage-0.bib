abstract={Information on public transport infrastructure factors affecting mobility and walkability within neighbourhoods among PWD in cities of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Singapore is limited. The study objective was to explore the accessibility of numerous facilitators and barriers in built environment within first mile last mile (FMLM) public transport in naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) neighbourhood within Kuala Lumpur and using Singapore as a benchmark. The research using Direct Observation technique was conducted through Access Audit on six routes at two locations, namely Malaysia (i.e., MY1, MY2, MY3) and Singapore (i.e., SG1, SG2, SG3), with a particular focus on five groups of PWD (Physical, Learning, Blind, Deaf, Elderly). The collected data were analysed for various environmental facilitators and barriers concerning connectivity, comfort, attitude, legibility, and safety of the FMLM public transport in the neighbourhoods. Four FMLM access to public transport determinants emerged and described in order of occurrence frequency in Malaysia case study: transportation service determinant, built environment characteristic, social environment determinant and individual attributes determinant. Different PWD groups had different vulnerabilities and prone to environmental barriers of FMLM in public transport system in Kuala Lumpur as opposed to Singapore. Therefore, it is proposed that walkability of FMLM neighbourhood to be integral component of PWD accessibility, connectivity, and safety when designing built environment in Malaysia. © 2022, University of Malaya.

abstract={The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic challenged urban public transport systems to maintain accessibility and service for daily users while adapting to local health and safety regulations. Developing sustainable and resilient urban policies under such crisis conditions requires understanding the different feelings, experiences and expectations of passengers and how these relate to socio-economic inequalities. Drawing on a mixed-method study in Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), Stockholm (Sweden) and Tallinn (Estonia), we show how the pandemic outbreak has changed both who uses public transport and how users experience their journeys. Challenging the narratives that portray public transport as a place of fear, we find that remaining passengers assess the risk of contagion lower than those who avoided it completely. We argue that promoting resilient public transport requires policies that address the needs of passengers relying on public transport services. Therefore, we question the current policies under the sustainable mobility paradigm for not taking sufficient account of the feelings, experiences and emotions and particularly of transport-dependent users. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={The integrated use of building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information system (GIS) is promising for the development of asset management systems (AMSs) for operation and maintenance (O&M) in smart university campuses. The combination of BIM-GIS with cognitive digital twins (CDTs) can further facilitate the management of complex systems such as university building stock. CDTs enable buildings to behave as autonomous entities, dynamically reacting to environmental changes. Timely decisions based on the actual conditions of buildings and surroundings can be provided, both in emergency scenarios or when optimized and adaptive performances are required. The research aims to develop a BIM-GIS-based AMS for improving user experience and enabling the optimal use of resources in the O&M phase of an Italian university. Campuses are complex assets, mainly diffused with buildings spread across the territory, managed with still document-based and fragmented databases handled by several subjects. This results in incomplete and asymmetrical information, often leading to ineffective and untimely decisions. The paper presents a methodology for the development of a BIM-GIS web-based platform (i.e., AMS-app) providing the real-time visualization of the asset in an interactive 3D map connected to analytical dashboards for management support. Two buildings of the University of Turin are adopted as demonstrators, illustrating the development of an easily accessible, centralized database by integrating spatial and functional data, useful also to develop future CDTs. As a first attempt to show the AMS app potential, crowd simulations have been conducted to understand the buildings’ actual level of safety in case of fire emergency and demonstrate how CDTs could improve it. The identification of data needed, also gathered through the future implementation of suitable sensors and Internet of Things networks, is the core issue together with the definition of effective asset visualization and monitoring methods. Future developments will explore the integration of artificial intelligence and immersive technologies to enable space use optimization and real-time wayfinding during evacuation, exploiting digital tools to alert and drive users or authorities for safety improvement. The ability to easily optimize the paths with respect to the actual occupancy and conditions of both the asset and surroundings will be enabled.

abstract={The development of sustainable transport is a priority in cities. It should aim to increase the number of trips made by public transport while minimizing social costs and the negative impact on the environment. The intensive development of cities from industrial to service-oriented and the phenomenon of suburbanization require changes in public transport services. However, often, operators do not change existing lines and stops or timetables justifying it with passenger habits. This approach may cause a discrepancy between the accessibility of public transport services and the demand for these services. Therefore, planning and improving the public transport system should be based on careful analyses. There are various approaches to this problem. The article presents a method to assess accessibility of public transport services using spatial and temporal analysis. The proposed method is based on dividing the area into basic fields and then, using appropriately selected measures, each field is assessed in terms of both the current level of accessibility of public transport services and the potential transport demand. A comparative analysis with the use of spatial tools indicates the degree of matching of these values and enables the identification of areas (basic fields) in which improvement of public transport services is required. For the proposed method, a case study was carried out for the city of Czeladź, located in Metropolis GZM in the southern part of Poland. The method can support decision making to improve the current public transport system. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Background and objective: Motorised traffic is growing rapidly in many African cities, creating barriers to the movement of pedestrians. This paper analyses the barrier effect of roads in Praia, the capital of Cabo Verde. We measured the barrier effect to potential trips to homes of other people and to food shops and analysed the distribution of the effect across areas and social groups. The paper contributes to the literature by: 1) quantifying the barrier effect of roads for the first time in an African city; 2) mapping the effect at the city level, and 3) developing indicators that account for land use (i.e. what is on the other side of the road). Methods: We used spatial analysis to estimate, for each building in the city, two indicators: the proportions of the areas of other buildings and of food shops within 600m that are located across main roads. We then analysed the distribution of those indicators using maps, descriptive statistics, cumulative frequencies, bivariate associations, and regression models. Results: In some areas, roads are estimated to curtail more than 70% of the walking accessibility potential of residents. The effect is higher in older informal settlements than in formally planned areas or newer informal settlements, and it disproportionately affects individuals aged 65+. The effect is lower for households with very high and very low socio-economic status than for those with high, medium, or low status. The indicators are robust to changes in the assumptions (e.g. type of roads included, maximum walking distance, attractiveness of destinations) and provide extra information, compared with simpler indicators (e.g. distance to roads or length of roads within a certain distance). © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Rapid urban growth and the devastating impacts of disasters and emergencies have challenged infrastructure and social systems in many communities. Recently, the nascent concept of “resilience hubs” has emerged to help communities overcome these challenges and improve well-being during disasters and everyday conditions. This paper provides an early conceptual understanding of resilience hubs, in particular their associated transportation needs, through a comprehensive literature review. The review identified characteristics and needs for planning hubs by focusing on their current definitions and related concepts (e.g., evacuation shelters, mobility hubs). In all, the review identified that resilience hubs could be a successful tool for communities in addressing the important needs of residents, evacuees, and survivors. However, we found that the placement of hubs is not methodical or optimized, and hubs have yet to be evaluated using metrics or key performance indicators. Critically, most literature and examples of resilience hubs fail to consider: 1) how people and relief supplies will travel to/from hubs, or 2) potential transportation services that could be offered by hubs. We recommend that programs that identify, design, and create resilience hubs should emphasize mechanisms for providing reliable and equitable transportation for people and relief supplies. © 2022 The Authors},

funding_text 1={In this context of resilience and disaster response, one unique and emerging idea is to develop “resilience hubs” where people and resources could be gathered to increase safety and quality of life. Current resilience hubs have been developed at the local level through partnerships with existing organizations (e.g., community centers, recreation centers, non-governmental organizations, Red Cross, Urban Sustainability Directors Network [USDN]). Traditionally, they have been funded by governments, foundations, other non-governmental grants, and donations. For example, Vibrant Hawai’i, a community-based non-profit organization, opened community resilience hubs to provide resources to Hawai’i Island residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The establishment of these hubs was made possible through a $1.7 million (USD) award from the County of Hawaiʻi through an allocation from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) and an additional $171,000 (USD) provided by the Hawai’i County Council ( Vibrant Hawai'i, 2020; Hawaii News Now, 2021 ). Alternatively, hubs have also been planned and funded by cities (e.g., City of Tallahassee (2022), Vancouver (2022a) ).},

abstract={Road infrastructure, an essential support system providing mobility and accessibility within residential layouts, has become a serious concern in several countries. In some places, residential layouts (subdivisions) have been developed through private ownership. If the norms laid down by central development authorities are not followed by local developers, land use, including road infrastructure, is affected. This study presents a quantitative assessment of the impact of improper development of urban residential layouts on road infrastructure. The study developed an index for assessing the road infrastructure within residential layouts based on identifying the deficiencies which affect mobility and accessibility. A road infrastructure development index (RIDI) was conceptualized using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and parameters that affect accessibility and commuter comfort in residential layouts derived from high-resolution satellite data. The parameters used to generate this RIDI were the number of approach roads, spatial road serviceability, road density, bottlenecks, population density, dead ends or cul-de-sacs, and road width. Sample layouts were selected from varying built-up land-use classes to extract the index parameters to develop the RIDI. The RIDI values estimated for sample layouts indicate the level of development of road infrastructure in the residential layouts. A case study of the Nagpur urban area in central India, showing estimated RIDI values, is discussed. The RIDI concept can be used for proper planning, monitoring, approvals, and improvement of road infrastructure in residential layouts in urban areas, especially in the developing countries, after its calibration for varying urban scenarios. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={With the advancement of science and technology and the development of the world economy, the global demand for energy is increasing day by day. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the utilization rate of fossil fuels. The key is to promote the rapid development of renewable energy and increase the proportion of new energy consumption. Therefore, accelerating the transformation and upgrading of the energy structure has become the top priority of future energy policies, and energy management has also become a hot topic in contemporary times. The high-speed and free population flow between cities has promoted the flow of production factors within the region, and a population flow network is slowly forming. The spatial accessibility index is used to evaluate the rationality of the spatial layout of urban facilities, and can also be used to test the service efficiency and the fairness of spatial distribution. This paper explores population mobility networks and spatial accessibility based on peer-to-peer interactive energy management. The purpose is to propose a good population flow network and spatial accessibility research method to explore the urban population flow characteristics and spatial characteristics with higher efficiency. This paper first introduces related methods for interactive energy management, population mobility networks, and spatial accessibility. A network analysis model of population flow is proposed, and the evaluation index and method of spatial accessibility are proposed. Finally, two experiments are done in this paper. First, we study the population mobility network in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The result is a correlation between the average distance of the network edges and the node degree value. The larger the degree value, the larger the average distance. The second experiment investigates the spatial accessibility of commercial facilities in Hangzhou. It is concluded that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of Hangzhou's total clustering degree is 86.3, and the standard deviation is 38.98. It proves that the global integration of Hangzhou is unbalanced and the degree of agglomeration is not high. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Introduction: This paper introduces OS-WALK-EU, a new open-source walkability assessment tool developed specifically for urban neighbourhoods and using open-source spatial data. A free and open-source tool, OS-WALK-EU is accessible to the general public. It uses open data available worldwide and free online services to compute accessibility, while at the same time allowing users to integrate local datasets if available. Based on a review of existing measurement concepts, the paper adopts dimensions of walkability that were tested in European city environments and explains their conceptualization for software development. We invite the research community to collaboratively test, adopt and use the tool as part of the increasing need to monitor walkability as part of health-promoting urban development. Methods: Tool development is based on spatial analysis methods to compute indicators for five dimensions of walkability: residential density, weighted proximities to amenities, pedestrian radius of activity, share of green and blue infrastructure, and slope. Sample uses in the cities of Dublin, Düsseldorf and Lisbon test the validity of input data and results, including scenarios for target groups like older people. Results: Overall, application of the tool in Dublin, Düsseldorf and Lisbon shows conclusive results that conform to local knowledge. Shortcomings can be attributed to deficiencies in open source input data. Local administrative data, if available, is suitable to improve results. Conclusions: OS-WALK-EU is the first software tool that allows free and open walkability assessments with pedestrian routing capacities for ‘proximity to facilities’ calculations. Large scale implementation for 33 German city regions in an online application shows the value of comparative assessments of walkable neighbourhoods between urban and suburban neighbourhoods. Such assessments are important to monitor progress in a mobility transition towards improved walkability and public health. © 2022},

abstract={Retail clusters lead to the establishment of cluster hierarchies and significantly influence the neighborhood economy and job market, mobility patterns, land-use change, and residents' quality of life. The prosperity or decline of retail clusters depends on the volume of retail sales. Few studies have investigated how commercial environments and agglomeration change retail sales while considering cluster hierarchies. This study compared the effects of commercial environments and agglomeration of retail stores on sales across retail cluster hierarchies at the district-level, neighborhood-level, and traditional market-level retail clusters in Seoul in 2019. Multilevel regression models were utilized to identify the effects of retail type-level and retail cluster-level factors on retail sales with diverse geographical data. The empirical models confirmed that commercial environments and agglomeration had an uneven effect on the variations in retail sales across different hierarchies. Specifically, dense and mixed land use, a higher proportion of the floating population, and higher land prices were significantly correlated with higher retail sales. The positive or negative effect of the proximity of small retail stores to large-scale retail stores and the density and mixture of retail stores on retail sales varied with the local context of the retail cluster hierarchies. The findings of this study show that considering the local contexts and features of retail cluster hierarchies is crucial for designing effective policies to ensure that retail sectors prosper across their cluster hierarchies. Practical Applications This study focuses on the effect of commercial environments and agglomeration on local retail sales, considering cluster hierarchies in Korea in the year 2019. The key findings from empirical models suggest a few insightful implications for the practical community. First, dense land development positively affected the local retail sales. Thus, strategies for land-use development should be harmonious with spatial patterns of retail sales. Second, a higher floating population has been beneficial for retail prosperity. Therefore, the pedestrian-friendly urban design would effectively support retail stores. Third, the presence of public transit is not directly linked with the better economic performance of retailers. Enhancing the accessibility of public transit improves higher retail sales. Fourth, large retailers were not always competitors of small- A nd medium-sized retail stores. The shopping behavior of large retailers and small, local retail stores within specific local contexts would determine the variation of neighborhood retail sales. Finally, cooperation among relevant policy authorities needs the prosperity of retail sectors because diverse commercial environments and contexts of retail agglomeration determine retail sales. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The problem of the lack of inclusive public space in the fringes of Bangkok, Thailand, is related to multiple factors in urban development. The study-area of the Pathum Thani province offers a summary of the critical consequences of the urban development in the past decades. The partial transformation of some environmental tracks onto an urbanized system allows the creation of a nonhomogeneous privatized continuous built surface. The conditions of these urban areas suffer from vehicular traffic, car dependency, absence of differentiated mobility, limited walkability, and lack of public spaces. The research aims to bring these areas to a higher level of inclusion, accessibility and overall quality by rethinking the existent public spaces, creating the grounds for the design of inclusive and accessible park. To reach this objective, the study explores the topics of public space, park, accessibility and inclusivity for disabilities to establish some principles for future design approach for Thaklong–Klongluang, a study-area located in the Pathum Thani Province. Characteristics, features, weaknesses and existing parks of the study area are demonstrated in the subsequent section. The results’ discussion relates all the aforementioned topics, defining the guidelines for the creation of inclusive and accessible parks in the six existent sites of the study area. Because of its premises, besides being based in a specific location, the article aims to be a valid reference for the areas which present similar features and critical points. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={This study proposes a Geographic Information Systems-based methodology to measure accessibility to urban services from the elderly perspective to support urban planning processes. Specifically, it seeks to understand and clarify how the urban environment can influence the quality of life for older adults, mostly through pedestrian and public transport networks, locations of essential urban services, and the organisation of their resources. In light of a significant demographic change, policymakers will have to promote age-friendly urban planning approaches to guarantee equal access to services and activities. We propose a methodology to measure accessibility to healthcare provision services that considers land-use and mobility features and older adults' behavioural traits. The method belongs to the family of 2SFCA—2 steps floating catchment area—which evaluate accessibility as the combination of both supply and demand of urban services. Therefore, we have introduced innovative elements to shape actual mobility opportunities for the elderly and their travel choices. The methodology was applied to Milan's city to measure accessibility to the Health Protection Agency (ATS) services, which is responsible for healthcare assistance to the elderly dwelling in the city. The outputs show that a significant share of older people (almost 40%) suffer from poor accessibility to primary health services and that they mostly live in the city periphery. Moreover, the application to a case study has shown that the methodology could identify the critical aspects needed to aid urban planning to achieve a high quality of life for elderly people. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Despite emerging research on novel mobility solutions in urban areas, there have been few attempts to explore the relevance and sustainability of these solutions in rural contexts. Furthermore, existing research addressing rural mobility solutions typically focuses on a specific user group, such as local residents, second-home owners, or tourists. In this paper, we study the social inclusivity, economic viability, and environmental impacts of novel mobility solutions in rural contexts based on published scholarly literature. When doing so, we bring both permanent and temporary residents of rural areas under one research framework. Methods: We used grey literature to identify and categorise novel mobility solutions, which have been applied in European rural areas and are suitable for travelling longer distances. By using six service flexibility variables, we reached four categories of novel mobility solutions: semi-flexible demand-responsive transport, flexible door-to-door demand-responsive transport, car-sharing, and ride-sharing. We analysed the social inclusivity, economic viability, and environmental impacts of those categories based on criteria and evidence identified from scholarly literature by including the perspectives of both permanent and temporary residents of rural areas. Conclusion: Integration of the needs of various user groups is essential when aiming to achieve the provision of environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable mobility solutions in rural areas. Results: Our findings revealed that while single novel mobility solutions are seldom applicable for all rural travellers, strong spatial and temporal synergies exist when combining different solutions. The need for a connected and flexible set of mobility solutions sensitive to the temporal and spatial patterns of mobility needs is inevitable. Accessible and easily understandable information on routing, booking, and ticketing systems, as well as cooperation, shared values, and trust between various parties, are key success factors for sustainable rural mobility. Conclusion: Integration of the needs of various user groups is essential when aiming to achieve the provision of environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable mobility solutions in rural areas. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={For Europe's urban agglomerations to be economically competitive, it is vital that international destinations be easily accessible. Although much has been invested in the construction of European rail infrastructure over the past century, passenger transport by rail has not grown as fast as transport by road and air. So why do people not use international trains more, even though they have an extensive international rail network at their disposal? Based on a series of in-depth interviews with relevant public and private stakeholders and two expert meetings, we identify the main bottlenecks and constraints. In order to understand the complexity of international rail transport, we have divided the existing bottlenecks into four groups corresponding to four layers of the rail transport system: mobility services, transport services, traffic services, and the physical and digital infrastructure. We formulate concrete policy recommendations for improvements to be made in the various components of the rail transport system. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Road networks result from a subtle balance between geographical coverage and rapid access to strategic points. An understanding of their structure is fundamental when it comes to evaluating and improving territorial accessibility. This study is designed to provide insight into the progressive structuring of territorial patterns by analyzing the evolution of road networks. Studying road network morphogenesis requires geohistorical data, provided here by historical maps from which earlier road networks can be digitized. A hypergraph is constructed from these networks by combining road segments into “ways” on the basis of a method for defining the continuity of road segments. Next, indicators are computed for these ways based on topological and geometrical features. The road patterns of three cities in the Burgundy Franche-Comte region of France (Dijon, Besançon, and Pontarlier) at three historical periods (the 18th, 19th, and twentieth centuries) are then analyzed. In this manner, their topological features and centrality characteristics can be compared from snapshots at different times and places. The innovative method proposed in this paper helps us to read features of the road patterns accurately and to make simple interpretations. It can be applied to any territory for which data is available. The results highlight the underlying structure of the three cities, reveal information about the history and the functioning of the networks, and give preliminary insights into the morphogenesis of those cities. Prospectively this work aims to identify the mechanisms that drive change in road networks. Detecting stability or variation in indicators over time can help in identifying similar behavior, despite geographic and cultural distances, as well as evolution mechanisms linked to specificities of each city. The study of road network morphogenesis can make a major contribution to understanding how road network structure affects accessibility and mobility. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper investigates the impact of visualizing the risk of encountering potential accessibility barriers on the route planning behaviour of pedestrians with mobility impairments. Using a prototype system, we explored the relationship between the risk of facing possible accessibility barriers and the navigation planning behaviour of the mobility impaired users. We found that mobility impaired users had a very strong inclination towards longer but accessible barrier-free routes instead of shorter potentially inaccessible routes (being willing to travel over 900 metres to avoid barriers), suggesting a degree of risk aversion that goes beyond the literature. However, we have also observed users' varying risk attitudes towards obstacles based on the type of impairments, mobility aids, and individual perceptions and mobility preferences. Our investigation underscores the importance of presenting risk information, which is currently overlooked in accessible navigation systems. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={In today’s world, accessibility is considered a key and complementary criterion while increasing the stability of a transportation system, in addition to the importance of proper density and spatial distribution of people and activities and land use development, which is known as urban policy and services and it is also considered a precondition for economic development. Although accessibility has been extensively explored in recent decades, transportation planners still face many challenges. Therefore, it is important to know the factors and criteria affecting access in each time period. These criteria can include mobility, quality and cost-effectiveness of transportation, the connection of transportation systems, mobility alternatives, land use patterns and socio-economic characteristics that can affect the concept of access differently; on the other hand, a more comprehensive study of accessibility can increase the range of potential solutions to transportation problems. The present study provides a general but comprehensive overview of the various dimensions and indicators of access in the form of a literature review. The results show that there is a lot of interaction with the goals of integration and sustainability, which can be achieved under the key elements. The first element is the selection of techniques that can be presented in the light of evaluation along with specific and clear objectives that can be achieved in practice and reflect their ease. The second element is the use of techniques to provide sufficient indicators according to regional patterns, taking into account all objectives, of course, as general performance indicators that are not limited to social justice. Perhaps one of the effective options is the use of visualization tools. It means using maps that provide solutions. It provides a link between transportation gaps and benefits where access-based criteria can potentially influence transportation decisions. Also, the findings show that to strengthen the accessibility goal, accessibility indicators should be clearly considered, and a distinction should be made between this concept and mobility in transportation planning. © 2022 WIT Press.},

abstract={Casablanca is the biggest city in Morocco. it contains 40 % of national mobility. Thus, accessibility to public transport network is a key factor for the development of the city. It is also very crucial to maintain a minimum quality of transportation services over time. United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), adopted in September 2015, highlight the importance of urban transport accessibility in goal number 11 and propose the indicator number 11.2.1 to monitor the accessibility to services, goods and opportunities for all. The objective of this research is to estimate this indicator value for Casablanca city center and surrounding provinces: Mohammadia, Mediouna and Nouaceur. This research thus contributes to the efforts to implement the objectives of the 2030 Agenda in Morocco, particularly concerning urban transport. We also seek to compare results for different public transport modes available in the city, namely the tram and the bus. To achieve these goals, we first propose an adapted methodology based on the metadata of the SDG indicator 11.2.1. To do this, we have created a Geographic Information System (GIS) database containing needed data such as administrative districts, urban roads, bus network lines, tram lines and population statistics. As a result, we found that 74,38% of the population in all our study area has access to bus network while 95.51% of the population of the center has access to bus and tram networks.

abstract={Risk can be defined as the relationship between the likelihood of a hazard causing a potential disaster and its consequences. This study aims to assess the likelihood that a new industrial region, located in the state of São Paulo (Brazil), will be flooded, causing the disruption of the mobility system and local economic activities. To fulfill this aim, a new approach is proposed by combining the vector information of the highway network that serves the region with the result of a quasi 2-D raster flood model, generating a set of interpreting rules for classifying the safety of routes. The model called MODCEL is a quasi-2D hydrodynamic model that represents the watershed using compartments called cells, and it was adapted to work using a raster file format in which each pixel is represented as a flow cell connected to its surroundings by the Saint-Venant equations without the inertia terms. Therefore, this study proposes an assessment framework that can be replicated for similar problems of flood risks to mobility. The possible effects of flood events on the accessibility to areas of interest are determined, indicating a possible disruption to economic activities and transportation and allowing for planning alternatives in advance. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Electric micromobility represents a sustainable mobility option for specific classes of users and distance thresholds. Had this mobility solution been integrated into a comprehensive mobility framework from the beginning, it would have expanded the coverage and accessibility of urban transit services. Instead, slow and incoherent regulation has established a contrast between enthusiastic users (who consider electric micromobility vehicles “fun” and “easy to use”) and recalcitrant public opinion (wherein electric micromobility vehicles are deemed “unsafe” and “dangerous”). Beyond the few attempts made by transport experts to assess the capability of e-scooters to become a sound mobility option (through mobility surveys, pattern analysis, fleet and routing problems), safety and infrastructure design should be developed in a consistent way in order to guarantee a balanced transport setting. With respect to this challenge, a methodology framework is proposed to address the increasing proliferation of micromobility in the context of a coherent transport system. Special attention is devoted to those aspects that have received less attention from the scientific community, namely infrastructure and safe interactions at intersections. The similarities and differences between e-scooters and bikes, chosen in this study as the representative of traditional soft mobility modes, have been taken into consideration. To support the proposed approach, tests investigating e-scooter performance and the perception of both the modes at safety-critical nodes (such as intersections) under different conditions are presented, and the methodology can be applied to a variety of urban scales. The results can be adopted by local authorities, transport companies and e-mobility providers to optimize infrastructure and increase the number and quality of available mobility options. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Investigating the correlation between urban mobility patterns and the built environment is crucial to support an integrated approach to transportation and land-use planning in modern cities. In this study, we aim to conduct a data-driven analysis of these two interrelated parts of the urban environment through the estimation of a set of metrics to assist city planners in making well-informed strategic decisions. Metrics are computed by aggregating and correlating different types of data sources. Floating Car Data (FCD) are used to compute metrics on mobility demand and traffic patterns. The built environment metrics are mainly derived from population and housing census data, as well as by investigating the topology and the functional classification adopted in the OpenStreetMap Repository to describe the importance and the role of each street in the overall network. Thanks to this set of metrics, accessibility indexes are then estimated to capture and explain the interaction between traffic patterns and the built environment in three Italian cities: Brescia, Catania, and Salerno. The results confirm that the proposed data-driven approach can extract valuable information to support decisions leading to more sustainable urban mobility volumes and patterns. More specifically, the application results show how the physical shape of each city and the related street network characteristics affect the accessibility profiles of different city zones and, consequently, the associated traffic patterns and travel delays. In particular, the combined analysis of city layouts, street network distributions, and floating car profiles suggests that cities such as Brescia, which is characterized by a homogeneously distributed radial street system, exhibit a more balanced spread of activities and efficient mobility behaviors. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Floor plan vectorization is an emerging research area in geographic information science and computer vision. However, automated recognition of building elements remains a challenge. This work proposes a method that combines the advantages of classical graphics with deep learning. Specifically, a morphological template is introduced to optimize topological relations, enhance completeness, and suppress conflicts. Bezier curves are utilized to represent irregularity contributing to improving visual effects and experimental accuracy. Thus, the proposed method can be directly practiced to boost performance and correct pseudo-samples in self-training. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerable improvement in CVC-FP and R2V benchmarks. Additionally, our approach outputs instances with consistent topology, enabling direct modeling into Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) or City Geography Markup Language (CityGML). Hopefully, this work can serve as a new baseline for further study. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.
Practical Applications Automatic floor plan recognition has many potential applications. From one perspective, structural elements (walls, doors, and windows) are the most typical objects as they illustrate the primary layout of a building and convey essential information to deploy other components. Identifying structural elements is particularly crucial because it provides design, investigation, and assessment representations. From another perspective, retrieving the room types plays a critical role given that it offers the semantics of a scene. Identifying these elements can avoid tedious secondary measurements and even recover the structure from an advertising paper or poster, facilitating the subsequent application deployment. The applications in Building Information Modeling reconstruction (such as 3D models from 2D maps, architectural arrangement, structural redesign, virtual reality, indoor navigation and modeling, 3D reconstruction from interior photographs, bearing structure analysis, renovation, refurbishment, plan illustration interpretation, apartment price estimation, and accessibility for visually impaired people) could provide substantial support for the smart city. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The Automated City Shuttles (ACSs) aim to shape the future public transportation and provide more efficient and accessible mobility in smart cities. With the absence of a driver, such mini-busses process the sensors’ inputs and exchanged data with other vehicles and intelligent transport systems to achieve a real time assimilation of its surroundings. Consequently, the technologies supporting the driverless functionalities ushered new cybersecurity risks and data privacy breaches. Unfortunately, several studies mostly focus on individual Connected-Automated Vehicles (CAV), though intrinsic underpinnings of the ACS's threat vectors remain unexplored. In the present paper, we considerably extend that investigation by proposing a comprehensive state of the art with farsighted analyses addressing security threats and data privacy concerns from both technical and legal perspectives to thwart potential attacks. Moreover, as existing approaches have not provided yet a clear road map about ACS's security standards, the present work sheds light on recent and up to date standards and standardisation bodies dealing with cybersecurity and privacy issues in the automated driving ecosystem. This paper presents an analysis debating the trade-off between maximising the ACS benefits and minimising the associated security vulnerabilities and attacks through an overview of technical and legal mitigation strategies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Human factors research can play an important role in the successful design of infrastructure to support future mobility. Through engaging users and stakeholders early in the design process we can gain insights before the physical environments are built. This paper presents data from a truly novel application of Virtual Reality (VR), where user experience and wayfinding were evaluated within an emerging future transport infrastructure to support urban air mobility (UAM) – the urban airport (aka vertiports). Urban airports are located in city centres where drones or ‘flying cars’ would land and take off from. Previous quantitative studies have investigated passenger experience in traditional airports using field observation and surveys, but this paper is the first to present qualitative research on user experience in this emerging mobility infrastructure using an immersive VR environment. Twenty participants completed a series of six scenarios aimed at understanding customer ‘exciters’ and ‘pain points’ within an urban airport. Results and recommendations from this empirical research will help inform the design of all future mobility infrastructure solutions, through improving user experience before the infrastructure is physically deployed. Finally, this paper highlights the benefits of engaging users at an early stage of the design process to ensure that future transport infrastructure will be accessible, easy to navigate and a pleasure to use. © 2022 The Authors},

funding_text 1={The purpose of the current research as presented in this paper is to better understand the user experience specifically related to a better understanding of the customer journey and wayfinding within this novel infrastructure of an urban airport to support future transport via urban air mobility. To achieve this, an inductive content analysis was conducted on answers given to the open-ended questions asked at the end of the VR trials. The signs to support wayfinding were designed by Coventry University specifically for this project and followed best practice for signage contrast ratios, font used, readability and size at fixed distances, and height above at key locations (see Federal Aviation Administration, 2013). This user study was conducted in VR before any physical build of an urban airport has been completed, meaning that user feedback from this VR trial can be used to improve future iterations (see Fig. 1).This work was completed as part of the AirOne project and funded by Innovate UK under the Future Flight Challenge (grant number: 75685), an Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) programme for the UK. Collaborative partners on the AirOne project are: Urban-Air Port Ltd (lead partner), Malloy Aeronautics, Supernal, Coventry City Council and Coventry University. The authors would like to thank Ryan Lewis and Dean Mangurenje from the National Transport Design Centre, Coventry University, and Ryan Atkins and Chul-Jun Sung from Urban-Air Port for their support generating the VR environment.},

abstract={Indoor wayfinding poses unique challenges for people with disabilities. Large, unfamiliar indoor environments can be difficult to navigate even for people with no disabilities. This paper presents a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon-based indoor wayfinding system that factor in the unique needs of people with diverse abilities. The system was designed using the methods previously developed for an indoor wayfinding system called GuideBeacon. Mobile applications for both android and iOS devices were developed for operating the wayfinding system. This work documents the guidelines that were formulated and the design decisions that were made when setting up this system in a multi-floor indoor environment. The results obtained from preliminary usability testing suggests that the indoor wayfinding system can be used effectively by people with diverse abilities. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={Inaccessible urban infrastructure creates and reinforces systemic exclusion of people with disabilities and impacts public health, physical activity, and quality of life for all. To improve the design of our cities and to enable more equitable policies and location-centric technology designs, we need new data collection techniques, data standards, and accessibility-infused analytic tools and interactive maps focused on the quality, safety, and accessibility of pathways, transit ecosystems, and buildings. In this workshop, we bring together leading experts in human mobility, urban design, disability, and accessible computing to discuss pressing urban access challenges across the world and brainstorm solutions. We invite contributions from practitioners, transit officials, disability advocates, and researchers. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Current web-based maps do not provide visibility into real-Time elevator outages at urban rail transit stations, disenfranchising commuters (e.g., wheelchair users) who rely on functioning elevators at transit stations. In this paper, we demonstrate UnlockedMaps, an open-source and open-data web-based map that visualizes the real-Time accessibility of urban rail transit stations in six North American cities, assisting users in making informed decisions regarding their commute. Specifically, UnlockedMaps uses a map to display transit stations, prominently highlighting their real-Time accessibility status (accessible with functioning elevators, accessible but experiencing at least one elevator outage, or not-Accessible) and surrounding accessible restaurants and restrooms. UnlockedMaps is the first system to collect elevator outage data from 2,336 transit stations over 23 months and make it publicly available via an API. We report on results from our pilot user studies with five stakeholder groups: (1) people with mobility disabilities; (2) pregnant people; (3) cyclists/stroller users/commuters with heavy equipment; (4) members of disability advocacy groups; and (5) civic hackers. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the concept of creating a crowdsourcing service for building social routes for people with limited mobility with the involvement of active volunteer residents. Several groups are involved in the in the service model: the main users are citizens with limited mobility, volunteers are residents of the city who are ready to perform small tasks, in the form of walks along the routes under study, moderators monitor the general order on the platform and the quality of routes. In the projected service, an elderly or low-mobility resident of the city can submit an application for building a social route from point A to point B, then this task appears in the general list of tasks, on the board of the crowdsourcing service, which is seen by volunteers. Any volunteer can choose this task and go along the route, studying the accessibility of the environment along the route, marking it on the map. The system accumulates knowledge about the city and its accessibility, supplementing the database with information from social networks, learning from this data, the designed system using machine learning methods will be able to independently plot routes for the city's low-mobility residents. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={Localization in aerial imagery-based maps offers many advantages, such as global consistency, geo-referenced maps, and the availability of publicly accessible data. However, the landmarks that can be observed from both aerial imagery and on-board sensors is limited. This leads to ambiguities or aliasing during the data association. Building upon a highly informative representation (that allows efficient data association), this paper presents a complete pipeline for resolving these ambiguities. Its core is a robust self-tuning data association that adapts the search area depending on a pseudo-entropy of the measurements. Additionally, to smooth the final result, we adjust the information matrix for the associated data as a function of the relative transform produced by the data association process. We evaluate our method on real data from urban and rural scenarios around the city of Karlsruhe in Germany. We compare state-of-the-art outlier mitigation methods with our self-tuning approach, demonstrating a considerable improvement, especially for outer-urban scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Although many studies are currently examining the city of proximity as a way to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly cities, few consider it meaningful to achieve an “inclusive” mobility model for people of all ages and abilities, including people with disabilities, children, or the elderly. This literature review paper focuses on the extent to which the city of proximity can provide inclusive mobility and reduce inequalities in the urban scene, thus achieving social sustainability. Out of the 256 references analysed under an integrative review methodology, only 10 delivered solid results. One of the main contributions of this paper is an indicator and sub-indicator system to improve the integrative methodology in urban studies, which led to the identification of several incoherencies in proximity models in terms of accessibility and design for all risking fostering urban with these policies. Although the mentioning of vulnerable collectives may mean a rise in inclusion awareness, one of the most relevant outputs of this paper is the lack of specific measures to revert the disadvantageous situations that conventional mobility planning delivers, as well as the neglection to use proximity actions to promote inclusive and socially resilient urban cities. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Anomaly detection has been an active research area for decades, with high application potential. Recent work has explored deep learning approaches to the detection of abnormal behaviour and abandoned objects in outdoor video surveillance scenarios. The extension of this recent work to in-vehicle monitoring using solely visual data represents a relevant research opportunity that has been overlooked in the accessible literature. With the increasing importance of public and shared transportation for urban mobility, it becomes imperative to provide autonomous intelligent systems capable of detecting abnormal behaviour that threatens passenger safety. To investigate the applicability of current works to this scenario, a recapitulation of relevant state-of-the-art techniques and resources is presented, including available datasets for their training and benchmarking. The lack of public datasets dedicated to in-vehicle monitoring is addressed alongside other issues not considered in previous works, such as moving backgrounds and frequent illumination changes. Despite its relevance, similar surveys and reviews have disregarded this scenario and its specificities. This work initiates an important discussion on application-oriented issues, proposing solutions to be followed in future works, particularly synthetic data augmentation to achieve representative instances with the low amount of available sequences. © 2022 by the authors.},

funding_text 3={Recently, several international projects intending to bridge the gap between research and the market for the next generation of security solutions have been launched. These projects do not focus solely on video surveillance of public spaces, one example being PREVENT PCP, which was launched to procure innovative and advanced systems to support security in public transport. This project involves some of the biggest transport operators in Europe, which consider that a concerted effort is required to develop solutions in this area. The identification of unattended objects was chosen as the main challenge in providing safety in public transport, after the findings of PREVENT CSA, which served as a case study for this project. The detection of abandoned or suspect objects is a part of the broader anomaly detection problem, and the proposed scenario includes in-vehicle monitoring. The final goal of this project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme is to allow buyers to steer the development of cost-effective solutions directly toward their needs. Additionally, it reinforces the competitiveness of the EU technology and industrial base by funding projects of public interest.},

abstract={Within the multiple urban–rural interactions that make up the territorial dynamics, this article addresses and identifies how mobility relations are produced between neighbouring municipalities that share services. The aim of this research is to carry out a diagnosis of the current mobility situation in an area of low population density in order to identify the needs and possible shortcomings in this area. The initial identification of weaknesses is essential in order to propose solutions for rural mobility. The methodology adopted is based on two distinct lines of work: (1) analysis of information in open data from public repositories using geographic information system tools (GIS), and (2) surveys of citizens living in the study area. The results allude to the fact that the most transcendental problem in the study area is the lack of a quality collective public transport service that meets minimum utility requirements for users, a fact that generates a transfer towards the use of private vehicles. No serious parking, noise, pollution or road safety problems are observed; however, similar dynamics to other rural areas with low demographic density are confirmed, such as the age of the mobile fleet and an aging population with accessibility problems. The presence of new modes of transport (electric bicycles, personal mobility vehicles, and even electric vehicles) is practically insignificant. Both teleworking and the new consumer habits associated with online shopping have not yet had a strong impact. Political decision making by public administrations is identified as a direct application of this research. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The urbanization process to which the Brazilian metropolitan regions are submitted has not sustainably taken place. These regions are characterized by the dichotomous center-periphery model of expansion of cities, characterizing an urban spread that induces a permanent-growth, of low densities, towards the urban borders, being the main cause of the challenges and difficulties found in the urban mobility of cities. In this way, more peripheral neighborhoods are progressively created, causing the emptying of traditional centers and generating gradual migratory flows for city residents. The mobility crisis has to do not only with the pattern of transport but with the use and occupation of land in a city that is much more dispersed, there is much more difficulty in mobility. The inadequate supply of urban public transportation in many of the major cities in Brazil encourages the use of private transportation specifically for long-distance and time travel. Lack of public transportation hinders the general accessibility of the population to leisure, culture, social or economic activities. This research aims to propose a procedure for evaluating the priority location for planning new medium and high-capacity transport stations that takes into account the position and occupation of dwellings in cities, taking consideration the interaction between the public transport network and urban land use. As well as considering the necessity to build up a systematized approach, equipped with tools that help in understanding this phenomenon and the relationships between the studied subsystems. The proposed framework is exemplified using People Near Transit (PNT) and population density indicators, in a study of the neighborhoods of the city of Rio de Janeiro, a major Brazilian city. The results obtained through the use of the proposed framework identified the neighborhoods in which the public power can intervene to improve the mobility of the users, facilitating the daily displacements using public transportation. It is noted that the present work contributes to the literature to complement the existing studies on the theme. In addition, the proposed model can be applied in other municipalities, allowing the analysis of the impact of urban mobility strategies on other socioeconomic transport systems. Therefore, this study contributes to the planning of cities, allowing, through a decision support model, to analyze the impact on urban transport systems. © 2022},

abstract={Many North American jurisdictions are creating walkable urban environments through compact Complete Streets (CS) geometric designs, while not addressing the mobility and accessibility of goods despite the essential role goods movement plays in sustaining the liveability of the community. Prescriptive curb radii limits recommended by CS guidelines to lower pedestrian crossing distances may not adequately accommodate the right-turn maneuver of a truck. The paper develops a performance-based decision support tool to guide the design of urban intersection curb radii that facilitate the safe and efficient accommodation of trucks and pedestrians. The decision support tool relies on a novel Freight-Walkability relationship to define the context of urban intersections and establishes a curb radius design domain. A case study demonstrates the quantification of the Freight-Walkability relationship (in terms of peak hour right-turning truck volumes and a proposed Walkability Index) and the application of the tool at an existing intersection in Winnipeg, Canada. The tool helps transportation engineers and planners balance the mobility needs of trucks and pedestrians through short-term street-level design changes and long-term land use transformations. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.},

abstract={It is now well established that car driving behavior impacts gas pollutant emission, fuel consumption and safety. With the rise of low-cost and easily accessible mobility data (measured by GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc), through OBD or smartphones devices for instance, the community is increasingly interested in characterizing these driving behaviors. In this context, we used the IFPEN's application named GECO AIR to access GPS data on which we derived statistical descriptors to perform unsupervised classifications and highlight different trip- and driver-related behaviors (dynamic, slow, traffic jam, etc.), on different road types (urban, highway, etc). Using Markov chain, we then generate for each characterized behavior a representative velocity profile and combine them according to a given use to estimate the associated real-world fuel consumption. Promising performances have been obtained with more than half of the recorded trips for which the real-world fuel consumption is estimated with less than 10% of error. The added value of the proposed work is the capability to estimate fuel consumption in a posterior way without any GPS records, as information obtained through a questionnaire for instance could be sufficient. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In Spain, fifteen cities have been declared World Heritage Cities by UNESCO. This implies a responsibility to conserve all the heritage wealth of these places. However, what is the point of heritage if it cannot be known and visited? In order to be able to do this for all people, in equal and inclusive conditions, it is essential to consider Accessibility and Universal Design principles. This is a challenge that requires a personalised study in places that were precisely built with the idea of being inaccessible. In particular, the study of the urban fabric and pedestrian itineraries are the determining spaces that this article develops. The aim of this study is to determine the keys and possible guidelines for the definition of urban accessibility indicators in the routes of historic city centres. For this purpose, significant routes have been sought in historic centres from the accessibility point of view: areas of high pedestrian traffic (in many cases for tourist reasons). Thus, six of the fifteen historic quarters of the World Heritage Cities in Spain have been selected for the study, with examples of good accessibility practices and difficulties that can be identified in their itineraries. For this analysis, an initial study of the existing documentation on the subject (secondary information sources) is carried out, in addition to a direct analysis (primary information source) of the graphic documentation compiled in each of these places. Subsequently, a complementary analysis will be made of some examples of good practice in pedestrian routes in historic city centres in cities in other countries. On the basis of this preliminary analysis, a comparison will be made to establish common points and singularities among the different case studies first, and then with other cities. This diagnosis provides results that are identified as 'keys to consider in the intervention on pedestrian routes in historic centres'. These keys not only address issues of mobility, but also location, orientation, understanding, etc., thus addressing a holistic consideration of accessibility as a fundamental principle for all people, and in particular for the elderly sector, which is one of the groups that is clearly growing and which, without necessarily having to have a severe or recognised disability, needs an accessible environment that is easy to use. As a main conclusion, it can be said that the results of this study do not only have an internal application for these cities but can be perfectly extrapolated as a basis for the elaboration of specific indicators for any historic city centre in any city in the world, considering the necessary adaptation to the specific characteristics of each city. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={While there are many places in Italy that cater to the population with low vision or who is blind, for example the 'Museo Tattile Statale Omero' in Ancona, the remarks made by the Unione Italiana Ciechi e Ipovedenti (U.I.C.I) of Bologna on the issue state that 'the issues produced by perceptual barriers, inherent in visual disabilities, do not find adequate answers in the current accessibility regulations'. To integrate the accessibility of museums and other cultural services, considered by UNESCO as a fundamental human right that must be granted to people with disabilities (article 30, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) the authors present a design, in its early stages, of a system that aims to make the fruition of scale models independent for users with low vision or who are blind. Said system aims to integrate some sort of augmented reality to haptic perception by reproducing sound cues to help users with disabilities navigate a single, or a series of models without any outside aid. The system is based on the deployment of technological plinths to support the scale models. This approach is well fit for retrofitting existing scale models while integrating the navigation system in an effective fashion. The activation of the plinths will be triggered using a smartphone app (either using NFC or Bluetooth) and will reproduce a set routine to guide the user in the haptic exploration of the models. On the outer rim of the plinths a series of triggers and devices will be placed for the user to interact, while leaving some space between the elements to house details at a larger scale or braille plaques. The triggers will be distinguished by their shape, a proud start trigger and a recessed end trigger; the interface is completed by an array of 8 speakers (one each 45°) with the possibility of ulterior sound emitting elements embodied in new models. The current design also defines the properties of the material that will be used in the prototyping phase by excluding rough surfaces that could introduce haptic noise and suggesting the use of thermoplastic polymers or stabilized wood over metals (since a metallic surface could be problematic in exterior installations due to its high thermal conductivity). The concurrent deployment of multiple plinths will consent the independent navigation and queuing of users in a contained exhibit by triggering a positional sound to guide them, while in urban context the app will have to be integrated with systems that implemented detailed voice guidance such as google maps. The paper ends by describing the future prototyping stages the system is expected to go through to fine tune the preliminary design. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Mobility-as-a-Service and Demand-Responsive-Transport schemes are promoting progressively a user-centered approach, made of modularity, flexibility and tailor-made travel experience, and pandemic emergency has furthermore enhanced this new way of thinking, thus representing an unprecedented occasion to develop a new paradigm for a more sustainable and resilient transport system, thus ensuring a greater level of social and territorial inclusion beyond traditional urban borders and outdated distinctions of targeted services for particular users' categories. This paper discusses the main features of MaaS and DRT schemes in order to assess if they could be able to cope with Universal Design principles and to improve metropolitan accessibility accordingly to the urgent request for social and territorial inclusion as sustainable development pre-requisites, made by different stakeholders in the international and European debate (see UNO SDGs or EU Cork Declaration 2.0), and re-launched by many national initiatives (SNAI for Italy, Espana Vacìa for Spain... ). To re-think metropolitan mobility as a service that can be shaped accordingly to user's needs and to redefine transport supply as a complex puzzle made by different and complementary services could represent a unique opportunity to overcome one of traditional public transport dramatic problems: low mobility demand, whether it be due to sparsely populated areas or connected with specific demands of targeted population categories. Hence this paper recalls some of the recent DRT experiences already active in Genova Metropolitan Area -the so-called DRINBUS above all- along with the on-demand mobility strategy for Ligurian internal areas in order to discuss how this new user-centered approach is acting on the marginalization of remote territories and fragile user categories. The choice to develop a MaaS scheme could re-shape metropolitan mobility as a comprehensive and global mosaic made by multiple pieces, thus making more resilient the entire system thanks to its modularity and redundancy. This allows to make more sustainable 'niche' services as well, according to the systemic nature of this mobility platform, thus opposing the present unsuccessful approach of creating ad-hoc options, focusing indeed on the user's request to travel from point A to point B, without the need to define him as urban resident, commuter, disabled or not, towards a greater social inclusion and territorial cohesion. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={The anomalous past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic have been a test of human response to global crisis management as typical human activities were significantly altered. The COVID-instigated anthropause has illustrated the influence that humans and the biosphere have on each other, especially given the variety of national mobility interventions that have been implemented globally. These local COVID-19-era restrictions influenced human-ecosystem interactions through changes in accessibility of water systems and changes in ecosystem service demand. Four urban aquatic case studies in the Netherlands demonstrated shifts in human demand during the anthropause. For instance, reduced boat traffic in Amsterdam canals led to improved water clarity. In comparison, ongoing service exploitation from increased recreational fishing, use of bathing waters and national parks visitation are heightening concerns about potential ecosystem degradation. We distilled management lessons from both the case studies as well as from recent literature pertaining to ecological intactness and social relevance. Equally important to the lessons themselves, however, is the pace at which informed management practices are established after the pandemic ends, particularly as many communities currently recognize the importance of aquatic ecosystems and are amenable to their protection. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Electric vehicles (EVs) will be the next technological leap for urban mobility, however the market penetration rate depends on several factors, including the major hurdle of limited EV charging stations. Equity is also an important factor – ensuring EV charging stations are widespread and available for all segments of the population. This paper outlines an innovative methodology to systematically determine the locations of EV charging stations while considering equity and efficiency to maximize accessibility and usage. The methodology has two levels. First, solving what is known as the Set Covering Location Problem (SCLP) by determining a threshold so that the distance (or travel time) between the consumer and the EV charging station will be less than or equal to a given value. This is a policy-based decision and provides a framework to ensure EV charging stations are ubiquitous and equitable. Second is solving the Maximum Covering Location Problem (MCLP) by considering a series of evaluation criteria to satisfy the demand of the early adopters. Following evaluation of the SCLP and MCLP, selected locations are aggregated by partitions to develop larger scale hubs. These hubs will not only include EV charging stations but will also function as connection points that integrate different modes of transportation. © 2022},

abstract={Transportation equity is an essential aspect of urban transportation planning. With climate change becoming inevitable, coastal cities are considering the mitigation of the impact of sea level rise on infrastructure. Transportation equity and sea level rise adaptation are usually considered separately. However, research pointed out that these two challenges could have considerable overlap and interaction. The present paper discusses transportation equity issues resulting from the impact of sea level rise and associated protection strategies. A case study of the San Francisco Bay Area points out cases where transportation equity can be negatively impacted when the optimal protection strategy against sea level rise is implemented. An integrated hydrodynamic and transportation model system is used in the present paper to demonstrate several scenarios where the most efficient protection strategies for the whole region increase the inequity that exists between the disadvantaged communities and other communities. Nevertheless, this impact can be mitigated with a relatively small addition to the protection strategy. The paper suggests that transportation equity cannot be overlooked in planning climate adaptation, as even the protection plan that maximizes benefits for the region may negatively impact the most vulnerable communities. © 2022},

abstract={This study adds to the nascent but growing literature on the use of big data for pedestrian route choice analysis. We explore behavioral preferences for various route attributes in Boston, MA using a large dataset of GPS trajectories (n = 11,165) sourced from a third-party smartphone app. Although the data are anonymized and limit our exploration of user heterogeneity, the sample size and area coverage are both much larger than seen in most previous studies. We estimate route choice preferences using a path size logit model, and operationalize the coefficients for policy-making through ‘willingness-to-walk’ measures. The value of these measures is demonstrated through an application of computing pedestrian accessibility to transit stations. Additionally, we compare our findings to a previous study in San Francisco, CA using similar data and methods, and previous literature to explore similarities and differences in pedestrian route choice behavior across major metropolitan areas more generally. While our findings can inform walkability policy and practice on several counts, we recommend future efforts to focus on supplementing this study by surveying hard-to-reach populations for more equitable policy-making. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: This paper addresses how transport-related factors and health service provision negatively impacts women's wellbeing and healthcare accessibility. It analyzes space-time costs for the transport component but also those resulting from healthcare quality provision. In particular, it focused on the role played by gender inequality in the distribution of space-time costs related to accessing healthcare for young children in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital city. Methods: We use a mixed-methods approach, with quantitative indicators and qualitative information to analyze the mechanisms that translate space-time costs into obstacles to access healthcare and women's wellbeing. We build on a survey of 409 individuals in healthcare facilities using a random multistage design to select the sample. We also carried out 30 in-depth interviews with users from low, middle, and high-income sectors. Results: We find that taking children to health checkups is women's work. In 3 out of 4 cases, the mother is present at the clinic with the child. Male presence is relatively infrequent and is associated with travel by car to the healthcare facility. Women tend to travel longer and spend more time carrying out the activity. They also have to wait longer once they reach the clinic. Women naturalize this fact in their narratives. Conclusion: We call attention to the need for an integrated approach to study the relationship between transport and women's wellbeing. The case study illustrates that conventional sectorial perspectives may overlook potential severe threats to women's wellbeing. Even with high-quality transport systems, these costs could persist if the quality of healthcare provision forces women to endure waiting time uncertainty and forego significant activities in their daily lives. © 2022},

abstract={Sustainable mobility is critical to achieve sustainable development goals. Public policy makers worldwide have introduced different policy instruments to motivate sustainable mobility such as promoting car sharing and introducing car license plate lottery. Limited attention has been devoted to studying the effects of these types of policies on consumers' accessibility in urban mobility system, in particular when these policies are intended to achieve the same objective of promoting sustainable mobility. To fill this gap, based on the consumer discrete choice behavioral theory, this paper designs a stated choice experiment and performs discrete choice analysis to investigate how the interactions of these two policies influence consumers’ mobility preferences and consumer surplus-based accessibility. By collecting data in Beijing, as an empirical context, we identify a nested logit model with a hierarchical choice structure, where bus and underground fall in the nest of public transit, while car sharing, private car and taxi are independent alternatives. Consumers who are participating in the car license plate lottery are more likely to choose car sharing, and car sharing can largely compensate for the loss of accessibility caused by the car license plate lottery policy, which implies that car sharing and the car license plate lottery policy are indeed complementary policies. However, the introduction of car sharing can also lead to an unintended consequence of higher total car usage by attracting more public transit users who never intended to buy or drive cars. This study contributes to the literature by proposing and implementing a generic theoretical framework for analyzing consumer preference-based accessibility for developing a sustainable mobility system and provides important practical implications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The concept of a smart city comes with the need to support a data platform that can gather, process and export the data of millions of sensors, coming from different sources, with information in different formats, in a scalable approach for real-time and historical data visualization, processing, and actuation in the city. This paper proposes a Data Platform for the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab, to gather, process, visualize and actuate on mobility, environmental and network data. The architecture of the platform provides a real open platform that is accessible for third-parties to collect data and to experiment their own solutions, through a secure and open data platform at their disposal. The platform was also designed to be scaled and modified when necessary, being composed by distributed solutions across the existent modules. The results with respect to the amount of data gathered, the ingestion and query performance comparison between the persistence solutions considered, and examples of data, show how this platform can be used to efficiently develop new applications and use both real-time and historical data for future predictions and actuations in a smart city. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Evidence for the benefits of walking has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners and encouraged them to develop healthier and more sustainable walkable cities. Many methods and approaches have been developed to measure walkability; namely, by using land use attributes. This paper examines the transferability of the Geographic Information System (GIS) based multi-criteria method developed in the Smart Pedestrian Net (SPN) research project to evaluate the level of walkability in a pedestrian network in Guimarães, Portugal. The method involves the assessment of 19 built environment and streetscape attributes, which were scored by a group of experts following the analytic hierarchy process. The method proved to be efficient in evaluating the pedestrian network and in mapping walkability in the study area. Around 65% of the street lengths scored above 0.60, indicating that the overall pedestrian conditions are favourable, with the best performance criteria being those related to accessibility and street connectivity. The method also allowed for the identification of different levels of walkability within the study area and the lack of a pedestrian network of highly scored streets. According to the results, the SPN method could be replicated in other cities to evaluate walkability and could be a useful planning tool to support policies towards developing more walkable cities. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Half the world’s population now lives in cities, and this figure is expected to reach 70% by 2050. To ensure future cities offer equity for multiple age groups, it is important to plan for spatially inclusive features such as pedestrian accessibility. This feature is strongly related to many emerging global challenges regarding health, an ageing population, and an inclusive society, and should be carefully considered when designing future cities to meet the mobility requirements of different groups of people, reduce reliance on cars, and encourage greater participation by all residents. Independent travel to public open spaces, particularly green spaces, is widely considered a key factor that affects human health and well-being and is considered a primary motivation for walking. At the same time, unfavourable steepness and restrictive access points to open spaces can limit accessibility and restrict the activities of older adults or people with mobility impairments. This paper introduces a novel open access proximity modelling web application, PedestrianCatch, that simulates pedestrian catchments for user-specified destinations utilising a crowd-source road network and open topographic data. Based on this tool, we offer a multi-criteria evaluation approach that considers travel speed, time, urban topography, and visualisation modes to accommodate various simulation needs for different urban scenarios. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the technical feasibility and flexibility using the proposed evaluation approach, and explain how new renewal strategies can be tested when designing a more inclusive neighbourhood. This evaluation tool is immediately relevant to urban designers, health planners, and disability communities, and will be increasingly relevant to the wider community as populations age, while the corresponding analysis approach has a huge potential to contribute to the pre-design and design process for developing more walkable and accessible communities for all. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The first step to steer passenger Urban Air Mobility (pUAM) towards the necessity of sustainability is to understand its impact on our urban transportation systems. This research emphasises the social footprint of passenger drones in scheduled operation as an early business model in European Functional Urban Areas. The literature review is guided by the corresponding Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators (SUMI). The prospective impact which the introduction of pUAM has on the evaluation of European transportation systems regarding their affordability for the public, their inclusivity for mobility-impaired groups, their accessibility to commuters and the level of customer satisfaction is analysed. Furthermore, the impact of pUAM on the perceived quality of public urban space is examined. Results indicate the overall social footprint of passenger drones in European transport systems to be negative. Early market pUAM may lead to an unbalanced distribution of potential benefits, with services tailored to address only a limited number of citizens. Highlighting pathways for a societal benefiting technology, recommendations are provided for urban planning and city development. © 2022 by the author.},

abstract={Over the last decades, new mobility offers have emerged to enlarge the coverage and the accessibility of public transportation systems. In many areas, public transit now incorporates on-demand transport lines, that can be activated at user need. In this paper, we propose to integrate lines without predefined schedules but with predefined stop sequences into a state-of-the-art trip planning algorithm for public transit, the Trip-Based Public Transit Routing algorithm [30]. We extend this algorithm to non-scheduled lines and explain how to model other modes of transportation, such as bike sharing, with this approach. The resulting algorithm is exact and optimizes two criteria: the earliest arrival time and the minimal number of transfers. Experiments on two large datasets show the interest of the proposed method over a baseline modelling. © NAVER LABS Europe},

abstract={Road freight transport involves many adversities, along with the growing effect of carbon dioxide transmitted by vehicles on the natural environment, greenhouse gas emissions, or extensive energy use. Within the smart mobility concept, the acknowledged management of enterprises’ relationships with customers within their service is profoundly determined by the deployment of compelling Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) applications in forming united cooperation with the customers. The paper proposes selected ITS applications as an advancement of logistics customer service in road freight transport enterprises that is divided into a group of six applications which are critical within the area of vehicle support, improving the energy efficiency of transport and reducing the negative impact of transport on the natural environment, reducing transport time but increasing connectivity and comfort, as well as a group of ten different applications chosen as crucial for general management support and increasing accessibility, cohesiveness, and control in management processes in road freight transport enterprises. The study also presents the effect of ITS applications on logistics customer service as dependent on an alignment between the group of ITS applications and logistics resources of road freight transport enterprises. The model proposed in the paper was analyzed based on the survey data obtained from 164 road freight transport enterprises in Poland. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Public transportation networks are well established in main cities, but there are some inconveniences in using public transportation in some cities. Public transportation is less accessible and walking distance of getting to public transportation is too long in some cities. Compared to other cities, Seoul has a higher satisfaction rate with public transportation. There are many cases, however, where short-distance taxis are used because walking to destinations after using public transportation is inconvenient; instead, Personal mobility (PM) devices can be used for these short-distances trip. This study aims to find the optimal PM service area using GIS(Geographic Information System)-based public transportation big data analyses. Variables were generated by collecting socio-economic factors, public transportation data, and geographic data and Extreme gradient boosting and Random forest, which are representative ensemble methods, were used for evaluation. We divided Seoul into a hexagonal grid and developed the optimal PM location service model by creating hexagonal cell data units and analyzing the areas with the models. We found that residential complexes, parks, and near subway stations (all areas with high foot traffic) are best suited for optimal placement. We also determined deployment should be in lower sloped areas. We expect this work to help determine public transportation stop and shared mobility station locations as well as contribute to public transportation demand surveys and accessibility analyses. © 2022, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Many cities in the world have developed metro systems. Metro systems affect urban development in many ways, such as enhancing labour force mobility, increasing urban productivity and promoting urban underground space (UUS) utilisation to accommodate urban functions. This paper explores the relationship between metro systems and urban development, with particular focus on the comprehensive impacts of metro development on the economic, environmental and social development of cities. The contribution of metro systems to urban development has been confirmed by numerous studies in many cities in the world. The positive capitalisation of metro systems is reflected in property values in areas surrounding metro systems, although the impacts may vary spatially, temporally and geographically. In addition, metro systems impact on the natural and built environments by reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging new development and urban renewal, sharping urban development and land use, facilitating commercial growth and residential development, promoting the utilisation of UUS, and increasing mixed land use and urban density. However, there are mixed effects, both positive and negative, of metro systems on equality of transit opportunity, accessibility and connectivity, public health, travel behaviour, personal identity, travel experience and safety. This study sheds light on the impacts of metro systems on urban development, and provides important information for urban and transport planners and policy-makers wishing to develop metro systems to support sustainable urban development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Minimization of negative environmental impact of transport cannot be pursued through mobility limiting, but rather through efficient utilization of natural resources. Some of the ways to reduce harmful pollution and noise include increasing the use of electric energy for transportation and developing electromobility. However, municipalities face difficult decisions connected with the siting of charging stations, for example, budget limitations are an important factor. The presented method allows for selecting a subset of existing parking lots where the charging devices will be sited. As the inputs, only easily accessible data is required. Applying a genetic algorithm combined with fuzzy logic and the Pareto front analysis, one could establish a set of optimal solutions for multiple pre-defined restrictive and partially contradictory criteria. The method has been discussed using a real example of a medium-sized city in southern Poland. Its results have also made it possible to verify whether a budget required for the planned investment is substantiated. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This article analyses the accessibility of public transport in Slovenia in terms of the proximity of stops and trip frequency. By combining the Central Population Register with data on the provision of public transport services, geographic information systems were used to calculate the share of the population living within a 500 and 1,000 m radius from stops with a basic number of daily trips. The spatial differences in accessibility were analysed, and the population density data were utilized to identify the main gaps in provision. Moreover, the location of newer settlements was analysed in terms of their integration into the existing public transport network. It was determined that public transport accessibility in the country is relatively adequate within a 1,000 m radius; however, within a 500 m radius, it is adequate only in most urban areas. There are extensive areas without adequate accessibility, which is a consequence of low population density particularly in the countryside, whereas larger gaps in provision appear in suburban areas that have grown outside public transport corridors. The 2004–2020 study period revealed a trend of lower demographic growth than the Slovenian average in areas with the best public transport accessibility, whereas the areas of the greatest population growth and most intense residential construction have been only partly located in the vicinity of the public transport network. This confirms the hypothesis that current strategic spatial planning documents are not followed consistently, and that transport and spatial planning are insufficiently integrated. © 2022 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia.

abstract={The main objective of the research consists of quantifying the degree of sustainability of the city of Cáceres in terms of the inhabitant’s accessibility to public services through the use of GIS tools and urban indicators, taking into account two areas of study: The Historic Centre (PCH) and the city as a whole. The methodology applied is based on the criteria proposed by the Spanish Government derived from the Spanish Strategy for Urban and Local Sustainability (EESUL), which suggests suitable indicators for analysing urban environments. The degree of sustainability of the study areas, applied to the field of mobility and accessibility to public services, is evaluated through numerical calculations complementing the study with accessibility maps obtained using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. The results show that the city of Cáceres is sustainable in terms of accessibility to bus stops, organic waste containers, household waste recycling centre, schools and education, health centres, and public administration. However, bike parking coverage and lanes, clothes and oil collection, and sports centres need to be further enhanced. In conclusion, there is little disparity in the results between the PCH and the city as a whole, not influenced by the fact that one of the areas is a consolidated historic area. This research has allowed some gaps in the topic to be addressed. However, the main limitation of this methodology consists in the need to have a considerable amount of initial starting data to be able to carry out the research. Finally, the sustainability analysis using urban indicators is considered a valuable source of information for the local manager, becoming a real planning tool in medium-sized cities. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={It is much more difficult for people with visual or mobility impairments to prepare for a trip or visit unfamiliar places than it is for people without disabilities. In addition to the usual travel arrangements, one needs to know if the various parts of the travel chain are accessible. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work that examines in depth travel behavior for indoor environments for both trip planning and execution, highlighting the special needs of people with low vision, blindness, or mobility impairments (MIs). In this article, we present a survey of 125 participants with blindness, low vision, and MIs. We investigate how mobile they are, what strategies they use to prepare a journey to an unknown building, how they orient themselves there, and what materials they use. For all three groups, our results provide insights into the problem space of the specific information needs when planning and executing a trip. We found that most of our participants have specific mobility problems depending on their disability. Feedback from the participants reveals that there is a large information gap, especially for orientation in buildings, regarding availability of high-quality digital, tactile, and printable indoor maps; accessibility of buildings; and mobility supporting systems. In particular, there is a lack of available and high-quality indoor maps. Our analysis also points out that the specific needs differ for the three groups. Besides the expected between-group differences, large in-group differences can also be found. The current article is an expanded version of earlier work [18] augmented by data of people with MIs. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The research problem discussed in the paper covers innovative mobility solutions in rural areas. This study aims to identify the specifics of innovative mobility solutions expected by inhabitants of rural areas based on the example of selected regions in Lithuania and Poland. The research was conducted between 2019 and 2021 in two rural regions: Druskininkai and Birštonas in Lithuania, as well as the Hajnowski district and the area of the Bialowieza Forest in Poland. The quantitative methodology was used, i.e., survey research. The research confirmed the proposed concept and showed relatively many innovative mobility solution proposals in both regions. Another method used in the study was correspondence analysis, which was performed to assess the strength of the correlation between the proposed innovative solutions and the age and education of the respondents. Comparisons were also made with the use of Pearson’s chi-squared test and the Cramér’s V statistical method. Among the options presented, organisational innovation—the synchronisation of timetables of various means of transport—was met with great interest in Poland and Lithuania alike. The introduction of electric bikes was considered the most desirable product innovation. Solutions that require the ability to use a mobile application are accepted, especially by young people and individuals with university-level education. The results of the research include transport solution models that are expected to improve the mobility of residents of rural areas. This comparative approach concerning slightly different rural regions in two neighbouring countries ought to be deemed a new approach. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Efficient shortest path algorithms are of key importance for routing and navigation systems. However, these applications are designed focusing on the requirements of motor vehicles, and therefore, finding paths in pedestrian sections of urban areas is not sufficiently supported. In addition, finding the shortest path is often not adequate for urban sidewalk routes, as users of these applications may also be interested in alternative routes that, although slightly longer, possess other desirable features and properties. According to the literature, the search for alternative routes is carried out mainly using the k-shortest paths (KSP) algorithm which represents an ordered list of all available alternatives. Even though various KSP algorithms have been proposed, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research addressing all issues inherent in a pedestrian navigation system. The purpose of this paper is to present a heuristic algorithm for graph datasets that implements a penalty-based method which, by increasing certain edge weights, effectively searches for the most accessible alternative paths in multi-route cases. To demonstrate how the algorithm works, we present experimental results on finding the most accessible paths in pedestrian sections of the historical center of Thessaloniki city. © 2022 by the authors.

A number of initiatives were taken through smart mobility or TOD projects to ensure smart urban living over time. However, there is a lack of consistent approach to combining smart mobility and TOD for smart urban living. The connection between TOD and smart mobility performance indicators remains unexplored for smart urban living. Therefore, the study aim was to develop a conceptual framework for eco-friendly smart urban living with the integration of TOD and smart mobility performance indicators. A compendious literature search was conducted to identify the smart mobility and TOD performance indicators. A Delphi questionnaire was also used to rank the indicators by experts. The eco-friendly smart urban living framework was developed with the integration of smart mobility and TOD performance indicators. This study found eight TOD performance indicators, namely utilization of transit nodes, user-friendliness of a transit system, parking at the station, walkability and cyclability, land-use diversity, access and accessibility, density, and economic development, that needed to be considered to design a city for smart living. Six smart mobility indicators, namely, location efficiency, reliable mobility, health and safety, environmental stewardship, social equity, and robust economy, were also identified and included in the smart urban living framework due to their importance to ensure smart living environments. Future research should test this framework using local data in different geographical settings. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={In many cities the (public) transportation system already faces challenges to adjust appropriately to the growing population. Lifting the transportation offer into the third dimension by introducing Urban Air Mobility (UAM) may be a promising step towards an improvement. But what characteristics does UAM need to offer in order to represent successfully an extension to our traditional (public) transportation system and to fit into the concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) where various modes of transportation are bundled and accessible on demand? On the one hand, the supporting ground infrastructure specialized in accommodating UAM and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations, in this research named vertidrome, and on the other hand a consortium of stakeholders (vehicle operator, vertidrome operator, air traffic management, passenger, city councils, etc.) will determine a considerable portion of these requirements. The vertidrome is a UAM traffic junction, which merges airside and landside operations and interactions between the vertidrome infrastructure components, the vehicles and the passengers. This research work focuses on the exemplary development of a vertidromes airside operation considering a UAM application at the Munich trade fair (Germany). Following this objective, we analyze the unique characteristics of UAM, review the current state of the art regarding UAM ground infrastructure designs and introduce a new and VTOL-specific terminology vertidrome. In addition, we define an exemplary vertidrome concept of operations: a linear and expandable drive-through (LIEDT) topology, distinct approach and departure mission profiles based on the VTOL vehicle Volocopter 2X, as well as operating (airside air) and traffic (airside ground) rules for arriving and departing vehicles. The results will contribute to the development of a corresponding discrete event-based simulation (DES) depicting the elaborated vertidrome's airside structure and operations followed by the development of a performance assessment method evaluating a vertidrome's airside traffic flow (Vertidrome Airside Level of Service - VALoS). © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Recent integration of LiDAR into smartphones opens up a whole new world of possibilities for 3D indoor/outdoor mapping. Although these new systems offer an unprecedent opportunity for the democratization in the use of scanning technology, data quality is lower than data captured from high-end LiDAR sensors. This paper is focused on discussing the capability of recent Apple smart devices for applications related with 3D mapping of indoor and outdoor environments. Indoor scenes are evaluated from a reconstruction perspective, and three geometric aspects (local precision, global correctness, and surface coverage) are considered using data captured in two adjacent rooms. Outdoor environments are analysed from a mobility point of view, and elements defining the physical accessibility in building entrances are considered for evaluation. © 2022 L. Díaz-Vilariño et al.},

abstract={The world is seeing a rise in demand for UAVs due to their versatile applications and aptness for widespread use. GPS signal is a critical input for safe and accurate navigation of UAS/UAV. It is now being globally recognized that The GPS (Global Positioning System) is susceptible to jamming and can be suppressed or lost when in urban canyons and dense metro locations. Jamming can be easily initiated using cheap jammers sold online and easily accessible. For both defense and commercial enterprise applications, GPS jamming continues to be a GAP and a barrier to FULL BVLOS autonomous drone operations. With an increasing number of UAV users relying on precise location services to carry out their everyday tasks, public safety and the country's defense positions (especially at border regions) would be jeopardized if the GPS was to be interfered with or even shut down intentionally or accidentally. As a result, in addition to safeguarding the system against unauthorized usage, it is critical to assure signal consistency at all times. Several standard bodies such as the SAE and ANSI standards have already documented the GAP and have begun to identify solutions to address the gap. Anti-jamming technologies are now being required in UAS and UAM systems in several US and international countries. Honeywell and infiniDome have jointly developed a "Robust Navigation System"that provides a multilayer resiliency against loss of GPS. This system is being utilized by several tier 1 UAS manufacturers and defense suppliers. We STRONGLY ENCOURAGE the Indian government evaluate and mandate measures for GPS jam-proofing in their present and future systems to enable safe operations of UAS/UAV in defense and civilian applications. Below we provide a few use cases and how a Robust Navigation System will provide safety and resiliency in operations. © 2022 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={With the modernization of smart cities and the technological advancement of the Internet of Things, we are now reaching a point where technology can be weaved into the fabric of our cities. In this article, we tackle the challenge of using machine learning to recognize the profile of pedestrians based on their gait and silhouette with the use a thermal camera (FLIR Lepton) connected to a Raspberry Pi. We present the additional challenges faced by collecting gait data in a noisy environment, and by taking human identification a level of abstraction higher and recognizing categories of people. The far-reaching implications of such a system in terms of accessibility, inclusivity, and social participation of semi-autonomous populations are discussed. The hardware, software, and cost of the handmade prototypes used for data collection are described. In an effort to take a step toward sustainable smart cities, the possibility of powering this system using solar panels is investigated. This article aims to share the lessons learned throughout the creation and deployment of the system and to share the promising first results obtained by the team. We have reached an accuracy of 74.63% for binary age classification (adult, elder), 93.98% for mobility recognition (mobile subject, subject with reduced mobility), 85.77% for group size estimation (one subject, two subjects, or more), and 77.29% for observed gender recognition (male, female) using a 2-layer CNN without any preprocessing on very low-resolution thermal images. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Transfer terminals with a high integration level could provide favorable support to Mobility-as-a-Service, which is essential to sustainable transportation. The interconnection of multiple transfer facilities in terminals would affect travelers’ transfer choices during their trips. Existing research on intermodality lacks an efficient multi-dimension indicator system regarding transfer facilities. To date, the selection of representative indicator systems and the construction of quantitative evaluation models based on these indicators that can reflect the coupling relationship between transfer facilities effectively and comprehensively are still challenging. Aiming at this challenge, this study conducts the work in the following three ways. First, the concept of the degree of coupling coordination of multiple transfer facilities (DCC-MTF) is proposed to evaluate the interaction among multiple transfer facilities. Second, indicators of diversity, selectivity, accessibility, and continuity are designed and used to establish the model by using the entropy weight method. Third, the spatial distribution characteristics of DCC-MTF for each transfer facility are geo-visualized and clustered. Field observation is conducted at Lelylaan Station in the city of Amsterdam, and the indicator analysis derived from the collected data is discussed. Overall, the quantitative evaluation model presented in this study, which is universal and can be applied to similar scenarios, is directly valuable for planners and designers who aim to improve the integration level of transfer terminals. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Urban renewal projects worldwide focus mainly on resolving motorized, personal, and low occupancy problems instead of sustainable mobility. As part of the process, traditional field audits have a high cost in time and resources. This paper reviews a spatial model of accessibility and habitability of the streets, oriented to the location of the volume of people moving sustainably out of an extensive street network. The exercise site is in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area, the second largest in Mexico. Here, the population that moves sustainably as the collective (public and enterprise transportation) and the active (cycling, walking, and others) represents a considerable portion (49%) of travelers, thus, confirming the need for intervention. The spatial model is elaborated in a Geographical Information System (GIS), and the main results are compared with the actual public transport demand using a neural networks process. The results of the tool as a predictor have a 91% efficiency, making it possible to determine the location of urban renewal projects related to the volume of people moving sustainably. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={In Nigerian cities, many different urban mass transit modes convey people from one point to another. However, each gender faces unique challenges and has different experiences of accessing and using public transport systems in metropolitan cities such as Abuja, especially with its growing increase in infrastructural development and its being the seat of government. Most studies of urban mobility have been undertaken in developed countries; there is little evidence on this subject in developing countries such as Nigeria. This paper aims to assess gender disparities in the access and use of urban public transport in Abuja, Nigeria. This research explored individual experiences and challenges in accessing and using public transport services and making recommendations for improvements. A mixed design approach was used to collect primary data comprising qualitative and quantitative data to achieve the research goal. Qualitative data were collected by conducting a focus group discussion which aided the researcher in gathering the overall perceptions of public transport commuters in terms of structure, experience, and challenges, and was subsequently used in designing a questionnaire for the quantitative data. This research sought to fill a gap in knowledge of gender disparities in public transport use in Abuja, Nigeria, by looking into the structure of the public transport system and how it affects men and women differently. The research findings revealed that females use more public transport services than males, that demographic characteristics affected respondents’ choices of public transport use, and that trip-related characteristics played a vital role in their use of public transport. It further revealed that men are generally more satisfied and face fewer challenges than women in accessing and using public transport services. There is, therefore, a need to improve the system to cater for the different mobility needs of women and to develop policies and frameworks to regulate the delivery of public transport services in Nigeria. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Accessibility and mobility are positioned differently at the heart of transportation planning; whilst a transportation system with high accessibility will not necessarily be able to support high mobility. In this short article, we evaluate and visualize the accessibility and mobility of pedestrian networks around the metro station areas in a transit-oriented city – Hong Kong. By using the newly released 3D pedestrian network for the whole of Hong Kong under the Open and Big Data Plans, we have created visualizations to compare the 500-m walking coverage area and reachable area with a 10-min walking distance that reflects the accessibility and mobility around metro station areas, respectively. We find that there are significant differences between accessibility and mobility for some stations. We illustrate the potential underlying causes by comparing three representative pairs of stations as examples. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={On-demand ride-hailing services are becoming a ubiquitous means of mobility in major cities. While convenient and accessible, they are costly for many, and thus ride-hailing providers are often offering pooling options that allow passengers to share a ride and split the fare. The downside of pooling is the extra waiting time passengers may experience as drivers make detours to find and board additional passengers. This paper assesses the competitive advantage of solo (single occupancy) and pool services and investigates the potential benefits of offering both. We characterize the search friction using bilateral meeting functions and present a closed queueing system to capture the pooling effects. We then derive the optimal fare, vehicle occupancy and fleet size for solo and pool services. In symmetric-elasticity meeting functions, we analytically show that (i) the pool service is profitable only when there is increasing returns-to-scale in matching, (ii) the solo service is profitable when the marginal fleet acquisition cost is low, and (iii) the provider should offer both solo and pool services only when there is decreasing returns-to-scale in matching. These observations are further validated numerically for more general cases. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Pooled-ride services have a significant potential for reducing traffic externalities and enhancing transportation systems in the urban environment. These services and their users’ characteristics still need further inspection and exploration. We investigated factors encouraging the shift from the currently used modes to pooled-ride-services, the choice between different pooled services vehicles types, and the frequency of use of pooled-rides, using data collected via a large-scale online survey conducted in Mexico City, Mexico (CDMX) for a start-up that organizes pooled rides, Jetty. We modeled the pooled-ride-service adoption process as a function of the users’ sociodemographics, latent travel attitudes, accessibility to public transportation, trip characteristics, reasons to use the service, and users’ activities during the trips. We estimated hybrid choice models and binary logit models, which show that users’ sociodemographic and travel attitudes are the main factors impacting the shift from different modes to pooled rides. Service-related characteristics such as multi-tasking, trip fare, and avoiding parking problems also impact the shift decision. On the other hand, the frequency of service use is mainly impacted by trip characteristics such as total trip distance, and the headway at the user's home location nearest Metro stations. Income, employment status, number of cars in the household, and gender were the only sociodemographic factors impacting the service use frequency directly and indirectly. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Urban dockless e-scooter sharing (DES) has become a popular Web-of-Things (WoT) service and widely adopted globally. Despite its early commercial success, conventional mobility demand and supply prediction based on machine learning and subsequent redistribution may favor advantaged socio-economic communities and tourist regions, at the expense of reducing mobility accessibility and resource allocation for historically disadvantaged communities. To address this unfairness, we propose a socially-Equitable Interactive Graph information fusion-based mobility flow prediction system for Dockless E-scooter Sharing (EIGDES). By considering city regions as nodes connected by trips, EIGDES learns and captures the complex interactions across spatial and temporal graph features through a novel interactive graph information dissemination and fusion structure. We further design a novel model learning objective with metrics that capture both the mobility distributions and the socio-economic factors, ensuring spatial fairness in the communities' resource accessibility and their experienced DES prediction accuracy. Through its integration with the optimization regularizer, EIGDES jointly learns the DES flow patterns and socio-economic factors, and returns socially-equitable flow predictions. Our in-depth experimental study upon more than 2,122,270 DES trips from three metropolitan cities in North America has demonstrated EIGDES's effectiveness in accurate prediction of DES flow patterns with substantial reduction of mobility unfairness. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={The link between transport and land use in urban areas has always been characterized by a slow evolution process. COVID-19 brought, suddenly and unexpectedly, severe changes to the trip structure within urban areas, as several restrictions were combined with individual health fears. This study addresses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the territory of Porto Greater Urban Area, in Portugal, measured under a structural accessibility approach. This was evaluated through a simulation model, combining different destination restrictions in three alternative scenarios during the pandemic and post-COVID, as well as the definition of four different personas, with distinct risk aversion to infections and telecommuting patterns. The results, presented as the spatial configuration of different mobility environments, foster a critical reflection on their implication for future transportation and land use policies. This pandemic has shown that the territory behaves differently under a critical lockdown scenario, where active modes gain predominance to satisfy most travel needs, signalling a potential ability to enforce more sustainable mobility habits. Still, as the territorial configuration tends to the previous state of equilibrium as restrictions are lifted, particularly for non-telecommuters, the need for acting quickly is reinforced. While the growth of telecommuting can induce additional challenges to the management of urban mobility systems, most policy recommendations that were valid in the past will maintain its relevance, as non telecommuters will retain previous travel habits. © 2022},

abstract={Several developed countries have implemented smart systems for public transport that provide mobility services for citizens. Most of these systems use special infrastructures to determine the location of citizens and public buses. However, the implementation of these systems does not take into account the poor infrastructure of developing countries. In Mexico, Urban Passenger Transport has insufficient transport units to meet the demand of passengers who move throughout the day, and these do not consider hardware infrastructure. Our solution is focused on inexpensive devices that are accessible to citizens, such as mobile phones. In this research work, a smart information system for passengers of urban transport is presented that allows passengers to know the expected arrival times and also to know the availability of seats on the bus that is heading towards their position. The solution was evaluated with real routes, and the results are promising for a pilot project to be put in practice. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The 2010 Merapi Volcano eruptions caused significant damage in the Sleman Regency of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Several households (HHs) were relocated to safely designated areas, but to sustain their livelihoods they have to travel back to their farmlands or change their identities as farmers. This study evaluates post-disaster mobility, aiming to clarify whether a land-use network with distributed livelihood options can complement rural labor in a recovery scenario. We collected sociodemographic and travel routine data in the affected areas. Then, the operational land use and transport microsimulation (OLUTM) model was performed to forecast a future scenario and gauge livelihood changes. Middle-aged farmers with upper median incomes and risk-taking behaviors were found to venture home businesses that contribute to rural labor. A 63% share of livelihoods diversified by farmers and 30% travel utility savings rendered a robust microsimulation system. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Electric micromobility systems such as e-bikes and e-scooters represent sustainable mobility options especially for specific classes of travelled distances. Moreover, the coverage and accessibility of transit services can be expanded through the implementation and promotion of these systems. Therefore, transport engineering is dealing with the development of new tools to support the forecast of the potential demand both for door-to-door trips and its integration with transit. With respect to these incoming research challenges, the paper proposes a methodology to investigate private mobility through floating car data (FCD) to identify the potential demand that can be shifted from cars to electric micromobility (e-micromobility) systems while also exploring the opportunity to increase transit usage. The benefits of such methodology have been evaluated on a real large test case, i.e. Rome (Italy), through an FCD dataset of about 240,000 monitored vehicles. The developed methodology is parametric and, thus, it can be easily transferred to other city contexts taking into consideration the compatibility of the local network infrastructures and the micromobility solutions. In Rome, it was estimated that the potential demand for e-micromobility can reach a maximum value of about 20% of weekday-trips, while about 10% of the morning peak trips could potentially be interested in a multimodal trip (i.e. mass transit services and e-micromobility for the access/egress). Results can be adopted by local authorities, transport companies and electric mobility providers to optimize infrastructural measures or the location of shared e-scooters and e-bikes to increase potential e-micromobility demand, as well as to increase the number of multimodal mobility options. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Rapid advancements in vehicle automation and a shift towards collaborative consumption trends will disrupt future urban mobility systems. We present a joint model of consumers’ affinity towards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) with two distinct yet related configurations: automated vehicle (AV) carsharing and AV ride sourcing. Compact and walkable built environment is known to support active travel and shared mobility but the potential impacts of built environment on adoption of automated shared mobility are largely unknown. Besides sociodemographic, sustainable travel, and technology-related factors, we examine the role of neighborhood-level walkability (composite measure of land-use, pedestrian-oriented urban design, and transit accessibility) in shaping public's opinion about AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing technologies. Detailed travel behavior and stated preference/taste data for over 2700 individuals from the most recent 2019 Puget Sound Travel Survey are complemented with neighborhood-level high-resolution data on built environment fabric. Two dependent variables of interest include individual's level of interest in AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing programs. A novel and comprehensive geo-additive heterogeneous copula-based joint behavioral model is developed - revealing complex stochastic dependence patterns between users’ interest in AV ride sourcing and carsharing programs and different layers of systematic and random taste heterogeneity. Results show that improving neighborhood walkability can be an effective way to increase public's interest in using automated ride sourcing and carsharing services. Findings also highlight the opportunity to enable SAV adoption by harnessing the synergies between green (transit) travel, technology use for work/non-work purposes, use of existing mobility-on-demand (MOD) services, and affinity towards automated MOD services. Results are translated to potential policies for designing proactive behavioral and built environment interventions for accelerating SAV adoption with an enhanced sensitivity towards the needs of distinct and more vulnerable population groups (e.g., older, unemployed, and/or less educated individuals). The study methodologically contributes by presenting a comprehensive behavioral model for SAV adoption by differentiating ride sourcing and carsharing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Automated visual data collection using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve the accessibility and accuracy of the frequent data required for indoor construction inspections and tracking. However, robust localization, as a critical enabler for autonomy, is challenging in ever-changing, cluttered, GPS-denied indoor construction environments. Rapid alterations and repetitive low-texture areas on indoor construction sites jeopardize the reliability of typical vision-based solutions. This research proposes a tag-based visual-inertial localization method for off-the-shelf UAVs with only a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Given that tag locations are known in the BIM, the proposed method estimates the UAV's global pose by fusing inertial data and tag measurements using an on-manifold extended Kalman filter (EKF). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) achieved in our experiments in laboratory and simulation, being as low as 2 − 5 cm, indicates the potential of deploying the proposed method for autonomous navigation of low-cost UAVs in indoor construction environments. © 2021},

abstract={This paper explores the role of socioeconomic metrics in the design, planning and operations of civil engineering projects within the specific context of resilience. The inclusion of resilience analysis and design is consistent with the goals of the ASCE Infrastructure Resilience Division (IRD) and related emerging standards and duties of civil engineers. This paper focuses on the practices in design, planning, construction, and operation of civil engineering projects that can deliver social value to communities and offers a set of socioeconomic metrics for consistently measuring these benefits. Socioeconomic metrics benchmark benefits including safety, social equity, health and well-being, prosperity, cohesion and inclusivity, and mobility and accessibility during the whole life-cycle of a project. A review of metrics is presented and expanded with an emphasis on the need for contextual narrative support to their application. The aim is to establish further the use of metrics in civil engineering projects to set values at the community level and formulate them to justify and rationalize resilience interventions and strategies. The reviewed concepts and categorized project metrics can be used by a range of actors in addition to civil engineers, such as urban planners, policy makers, or regional developers, preferably in a collaborative manner across these groups, particularly to help prioritize the investment of resources and funds to achieve resilience. Three project examples at differing levels of complexity are presented to conceptually illustrate the approaches outlined herein. © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.},

abstract={Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as critical points in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In particular, the discharging effluents from WWTPs generally bring downstream catchment areas exogenous ARGs and resistant bacteria. However, there lacks a sufficient assessment of the resistome and mobilome in effluents. In this study, a consecutive monthly sampling was conducted over 13 months in three Hong Kong (HK) WWTPs for metagenomic sequencing. Prevalence information of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was compared with counterparts in effluents from cities of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Moreover, a publicly accessible platform integrating the exposure ranking scheme, which was based on the global archive of ARG abundance, and a readily implementable online pipeline was developed to benefit communication in academia and government consultancy. Results demonstrated HK WWTPs were featured high ARG removal efficiency of 2.34–2.43 log reduction rate, and effluents were ranked in moderate levels of Level 2 and Level 3 in the exposure prioritizing scheme based on total ARG abundance. Moreover, absolute quantification of temporal variations of effluent resistome disclosed distinct changes over time among varied ARG types which were associated with prevalently used antibiotics, including quinolone and sulfonamide. This reinforces the need for real-time management of WWTP systems. Notably, ARGs of anthropogenic prevalence, high mobility, and potential pathogenicity were found to be present in HK effluents, drawing attention to the necessity for improved risk management. In addition, source tracking of effluent resistome and structural equation model analysis was conducted to explore the disparity in ARG abundance and diversity in different samples. The discovery of this study and the recommendation of a comprehensive exposure assessment will facilitate decision-making in resistome management in WWTPs to reduce the ARG and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) contamination in the receiving environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Car ownership and use is a main contributor to the deterioration of air quality in cities and to global warming. There is thus a pressing need to understand their determinants in this era of increasing demand for mobility. This paper studies car ownership and use decisions in a car-dominant developing country context, and quantifies the effect of public transportation availability on these decisions. A discrete–continuous modeling framework that estimates car ownership and use simultaneously is presented. People’s latent attitudes towards public transportation and the private car are also assumed to influence these decisions. The model is applied to the case of Lebanon, a developing country characterized by a high car ownership rate, a high percentage of trips made by car, and an informal public transportation system. Five policy scenarios involving potential improvements to the public transportation system, land use densification, or increase in fuel taxes were tested. The findings show that the current public transportation accessibility level has a minor impact on car ownership, but none on car usage. Only if major improvements to the public transportation services are enacted would a decrease in car ownership and usage be achieved. In such a case, model outcomes show that car ownership will be reduced in households with two cars by 5.88% and usage in general will be reduced by 15.22%. As a result, emissions and fuel consumption will be reduced by around 15%. Densification of zones outside Municipal Beirut is also a promising strategy for reducing car usage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Visual impairment is a global problem and people without vision suffer more than other impaired people. A companion is always needed for the movement of blind people and there may not be anyone by their side in case of emergency. Walking alone on the street, detecting the person closest to him and avoiding obstacles are always problems. Researchers have been working for visually impaired people using sensor based distance measurement systems for years. This paper proposes a Computer Vision based system to navigate visually impaired people by using Artificial Intelligence, and also a novel distance measuring approach. The system will capture real time images through a camera placed inside a sun-glass then process the video frames by trained YOLO V3 model. After processing, the program will identify a total of 80 pre-trained objects and additional 7 objects including person, car, bicycle, and broken roads and then will produce a navigation command through headphones. A comparative evaluation with other similar works is performed, and the result represents the primary accomplishments of this article. Several testing and validation procedures were carried out in order to achieve optimal performance and accurate distance measurement. The proposed system outperforms the state-ofthe-art in terms of object detection, distance measurement, computational costs calculation, and accessibility for the visually impaired, according to the results, which were validated using mathematical calculations and the necessary measuring devices. Since Industry 4.0 demands smart automation, this system has a significant impact not just on disabled persons but also on the development of a smart city. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new navigation device to assist visually impaired people reach a defined destination safely in the indoor environment. This approach based on visual-auditory substitution provides the user a 2D spatial sound perception of the destination and of nearby and dangerous obstacles. Visual markers are placed at several relevant locations to create a mesh of the building where each marker is visually accessible from another marker. A graph representation of markers locations and their connection to each other defines by a way finding algorithm the shortest path reach to the wished position. The navigation task is achieved by moving from visual marker to visual marker until the desired destination is reached. These markers can be used independently of any other system or in addition to other solutions based on geolocalisation and/or a digital building model. Moreover, further information can be associated to the markers, and therefore verbalize to the user for instance a temporary hazards, a door presence or any other usual displayed information. The passive visual markers enables to deploy easily and quickly a scalable and low-cost solution to "signpost"the environment for users. Combined with our realtime implemented obstacle detection, their analysis enables the navigational abilities of visually impaired people to be improved. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the large number of traffic sensors that may be used to gather traffic data, lots of work has done in the development of traffic prediction algorithms for improving route navigation, urban planning and traffic management, among other things. One of the most challenging characteristics of traffic forecasting is determining and how much to be dependent on models built from previous data in actual traffic situations, which may vary from past data and change over time. This study presents a new accessible structure that can acquire from real-time traffic situation (or contexts) and forecast future traffic by comparing the current situation to the best effective prediction model developed from prior data. The traffic environment space is adaptive adjustable partitioned as real-time traffic enters the system, allowing each base predictor's performance to be evaluated effectively under diverse scenarios. As a result of our online technique, both long-term and short-term performance guarantees are generated and demonstrated in this study. When authentic labels are not available or delayed, the proposed approach remains effective. It is also feasible to identify which component of the traffic prediction scenario is the most significant, which can help reduce implementation complexity while simultaneously providing relevant information to traffic policymakers. The suggested strategy outperforms existing solutions on real-world data in real-world circumstances, according to our research. Using correlated and collinear traffic data, the proposed model can accurately and effectively predict short-term traffic conditions. Mainly three type of case studies created for demonstrate the model's use in short-term traffic forecasting applications © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The HYEP project (ANR HYEP 14-CE22-0016-01 Hyperspectral imagery for Environmental urban Planning - Mobility and Urban Systems Programme - 2014) confirmed the interest of a global approach to the urban environment by remote sensing and in particular by using hyperspectral imaging (HI). The interest of hyperspectral images lies in the range of information provided over wavelengths from 0.4 to 4 μm; they thus provide access to spectral quantities of interest and to chemical or biophysical parameters of the surface. HYEP's objective was to specify this and to propose a panel of methods and treatments taking into account the characteristics of other existing sensors in order to compare their performance. The developments carried out were applied and evaluated on hyperspectral airborne images acquired in Toulouse and Kaunas (Lithuania), also used to synthesize space systems: Sentinel-2, Hypxim/Biodiversity and Pleiades. Among the locks identified were those related to improving the spatial capabilities of the sensors and spatial scale changes, which were partially overcome by fusion and sharpening approaches, which proved to be successful. After a description of our hyperspectral data set acquired over Toulouse, an analysis is conducted on several existing and accessible spectral databases. Then, the chosen methods are presented. They include extraction, fusion and classification methods, which are then applied on our dataset synthetized at different spatial resolution to evaluate the benefits and the complementarity of hyperspectral imagery in comparison with other traditional sensors. Some specific applications are investigated of interest for urban planners: impervious soil map, vegetation species cartography and detection of solar panels. Finally, discussion and perspectives are presented. © 2022 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Routing modeling and the VANET simulation are identical, except VANET context imposes unique challenges and needs, such as constrained road topography, cross, and side, which are fundamentally different form MANETs connection. Connectivity, traffic signals, gridlock, trip models, different vehicle speeds, driving capabilities, and locations. There are both network simulations and VANET simulators now that Iot mobility is available. This article provides a thorough analysis and comparison of several VANET simulation software and the widely accessible parts that make them up. We specifically differentiate between their GUIs, repute, simplicity of use, input needs, output visualization capabilities, and model accuracy. The last point is that each computed simulator offers a live model before being employed by the research team, more explanations and contributions are expected. This framework makes use of the 'Input Path Files' feature of the OpenNet architecture and the open-source program 'Urban Motion Simulation' (Sumo). Each member contributes to the OpenStreetMap, and they routinely hear from each other. Prioritizing how and what should be done will be made easier with the support of other voices during united voice. This is ensured by a continuous 'thank you' for making it beautiful. The survey will assist in establishing guidelines to direct concerns to the appropriate parties, and Mapper will aid members in contributing to and sharing solutions to the issues, as well as indicate locations where responding with a specific response is appropriate. needs extra assistance. For further in-depth follow-up, we will identify specific individuals and themes. This may only be effective and helpful if there is transparent follow-up on the survey results. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems is essential to African cities’ economic vitality through accessibility and expansion of urban mobility. Several studies have investigated the deployment of such transportation systems. However, the role of a delineated planning stage of BRTs has been given limited attention. This study examined the role of planning in ensuring the sustainable performance of BRT systems. A qualitative approach using interviews with experts and BRT users in the Gauteng Province of South Africa was adopted. Findings indicated that planning should extensively encompass projections of the intended or future performance outcomes. These include institutional arrangements, existing characteristics and impact, service reliability and quality, technical analysis of infrastructural integration, demand, environmental performance metrics and life cycle costs. This inductive research advances the theory of critical factors that could potentially hinder the delivery of PPP-based BRT projects. The findings are envisaged to be beneficial to transport policymakers and stakeholders in the assessment of BRT systems. Failures surrounding the BRT in Gauteng result from an omission of critical factors at the planning stage. This presents a critical lesson for future BRT projects in South Africa and other developing countries, to be meticulous and consider critical factors at the planning stage. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.

abstract={In recent times, population growth has contributed to increased motorization and urbanization in Pakistan which hinders traffic mobility. As a consequence, the country is faced with urban sprawl that leads to almost daily recurrent gridlocks on roads. Due to the changing landscape of the Central business district and suburban development, accessibility to workplaces is decreasing and people see cars and other automobiles as a necessary addition to their life. Burgeoning twin cities like Rawalpindi and Islamabad incur economic costs due to traffic congestion observed during peak hours, as people move to their workplaces, schools, colleges, business centers, recreational places, etc. through the main thoroughfare i.e. Peshawar Road, Rawalpindi highway. The traffic congestion has inflated the twin cities and is exacerbated due to a lack of proper transportation planning and design needs resulting in an imbalance between the demand and capacity of road networks. These traffic delays lead to road damages and environmental degradation and end up costing road users fuel costs in terms of lost time. Furthermore, the public well-being is impacted by air and noise pollution having health implications. The paper attempts to address and mitigate traffic delays and congestion issues on Peshawar Road, Rawalpindi by using pre-timed split and protected phasing with signal coordination, offset, and bandwidth techniques in the software Synchro Studio. The preliminary data for this research was collected through an extensive literature review, traffic counts, and the geometrical features of the Peshawar road highway. The current traffic condition analyzed, is based on pre-timed split phasing without signal coordination. Subsequently, improved design alternatives are considered for an efficient movement of vehicles whichare based on pre-timed split and protected phasing with signal coordination. These simulations are modeled in Synchroto optimize road user travel time. The benefits of each phasing scheme are compared to conclude that protected phasingwith signal coordination reduces the travel time and total delays of the vehicles traversing the corridor by up to 52.8 % and 56% respectively when compared with the prevailing situation. © 2022 International Conference on Construction in the 21st Century.

abstract={Mini macrocell base station deployments, also known as femtocells, enhance the energy efficiency of both indoor and outdoor subscribers. Nonetheless, Handover Decision Algorithm (HDA) is still a major challenge in their adoption to improve the energy efficiency (EE) of Advanced LTE system. This paper is geared at this topic, with an emphasis on the most critical component of Energy Efficiency in Advanced LTE technology. Executing a handoff choice within the femtocell macrocell system for energy efficient network in Advanced LTE is a critical study area in handover management. In this paper, decision methods are categorized and compared based on reception speed of the user's equipment, signal strength, interruption, and operational expense in the Advanced LTE network speed. Although, this was discovered by the majority in the addressed decisions algorithm that they struggle in acknowledging selection of cell and throughput with access policy in hybrid system within one macrocell to improve EE. Several situations for femtocell like the majority of these algorithms fail to incorporate the user equipment (UE) residence parameter in order to achieve energy efficiency. The absence of this parameter (UE) increases the amount of unnecessary handovers. This paper offers an enhanced handover decision algorithm relying upon a frameless network designed to improve system energy efficiency (EE). We present UE system's EE optimization including limits on Mobility Management (MM) adaption in this paper. A sophisticated algorithm for handover selection has been suggested to see how to increase energy efficiency in Advanced LTE systems to address these problems. The user's speed, the intensity of the signal they got, how long they were there, power-optimization in EE and thus the femtocell base station's accessible policies are all taken into account by the suggested algorithm. In femtocell installations, it is crucial to address the issue of the volume of pointless handover brought on by excessive initiations. In this paper, we applied the approaches of handoff hysteresis margin, window mechanism, and an extension of the conventional time to trigger approach to resolve unneeded handover number difficulties. According to simulation results, the suggested algorithm increase the efficiency of energy in Advanced LTE networks while when there is comparison with the conventional received signal strength-based replacement of choice method, reducing the frequency of pointless handovers thereby improving the QoS. Finally, the scheme of results from simulations show that the overall energy efficiency have greatly increased with restrictions on the Handover choice mechanism of the users in the Advanced LTE network. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The changing climate has amplified the intensities and scales of the environmental stresses with disproportional impacts on global cities. Building equity and resilience for cities to cope with disaster impacts it in an urgent need. Cities are composed of the built environment that shapes humans' mobility and capabilities to survive in disasters. Hence, integrating human mobility and infrastructure design may hold the key to building equity and resilience for our cities. However, a methodological framework is missing to analyze the interdependencies and interactions between human mobility and infrastructure systems to inform the design of equitable and resilient urban spaces. Here, we summarize our studies on characterizing complex urban environments, modeling human-infrastructure interactions, and proposing an optimal scenario that improves equity and resilience of population accessibility to infrastructures. Our work has broad implications for the integration of humans and infrastructure in digital space through smart city digital twins. We finally propose a design of the digital space to connect the societal challenges of equity and resilience with the technological innovations in the digital twin. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The majority of industrial environments and homewares need help when exploring unknown locations owing to a lack of understanding about the building structure and the various impediments that may be faced while transporting products from one spot to another. This is because there is a lack of knowledge about the building structure and the potential obstacles that may be encountered. This paper provides 'Computer Vision-Based Navigation Robot' as a strategy for indoor navigation with optimal accessibility, usability, and security, decreasing issues that the user may encounter when traveling through indoor and outdoor areas with real-time monitoring of the most up to date IoT technology. The article is titled 'Indoor Navigation with Optimal Accessibility, Usability, and Security.' This article proposes 'Computer Vision-Based Navigation Robot' as a solution for interior navigation that provides optimum accessibility, usability, and security. This is done in order to tackle the issue that was presented before. Since the readers of this post include people who work in industry as well as physically challenged people who live alone, CVBN Robot takes object-based inputs from its surroundings. This is because the audience for this essay includes both groups of people. This study also covers a variety of methods for localization, sensors for the detection of obstacles, and a protocol for an Internet of Things connection between the server and the robot. This connection enables real-time position and status updates for the robot as it navigates a known but unknown interior environment. In addition, this study covers a variety of methods for localization, sensors for the detection of obstacles, and a protocol for an Internet of Things connection between the server and the robot. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={This article presents the issue of using decision support tools to select the variant of organization of urban transport system. Two scenarios for the use of electric vehicles were compared, considering not only their emissions and fuel consumption but also the limited accessibility of conventional vehicles to the city. The authors assume that the development of urban traffic organization must go hand in hand with the challenges of planning sustainable urban mobility and reducing harmful exhaust fumes. Furthermore, decision-makers should be equipped with simple decision support tools to generate the best option considering the expectations of transport users. The PTV VISUM tool was used to analyse and visualize two different organization scenarios for a selected city in Poland. © 2022 Scientific Journal of Silesian University of Technology.

abstract={To provide reliable services, mobile network operators (MNOs) continuously collect vital mobile network performance data to monitor and analyze the functioning of their radio access networks (RANs). RAN is a critical infrastructure for mobile networks and its performance is measured by key performance indicators (KPIs) such as accessibility, retainability, availability, integrity, and mobility. The standard practice is that network managers utilize KPIs to identify failures or unusual events that can significantly degrade the quality of service delivery and the end-users’ experiences. However, taking corrective steps based on monitored performance parameters is a reactive approach that contributes to network and service degradations until corrective actions are taken. With the monitoring and automation of RAN infrastructure performance in mind, this paper presents the Markov chain, a widely used probabilistic modeling approach, as a systematic method for jointly predicting network accessibility and retainability status, two of the crucial RAN performance measures. The novel joint prediction is proposed to have a single operation for both accessibility and retainability. Real-time hourly KPIs data was collected from 1530 cells (base stations) run by an operator’s network in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for 4 months, from 1 November 2020 to 28 February 2021. The cells are scattered across the capital city, where factors such as land use, settlement patterns, and customers behaviors differ. To capture the spatial variation of the KPIs without escalating the computational complexity much, the dataset is separated into six clusters using the K-mean clustering approach. The Markov chain KPIs status prediction models are formulated on a cluster level. The results reveal that the proposed models can predict the KPIs status with 94.61 percent accuracy. Because the data is already available and can be collected at any time using the operator’s network management system (NMS), this is a cost-effective technique to proactively improve mobile network performance. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Activities intended at increasing the accessibility of offers connected with urban growth and efforts and pragmatic practices targeted at boosting community contact through the usage of common areas contribute to cultural integration in the urban context. Bag Bazar Street is one of Kolkata’s three main streets, known as the grandmother road in ekantoporibar (joint family), making it an excellent case study site. By developing and assessing ideas regarding urban mobility characteristics and linkages across time, syntactic space analyses aid in the examination of diverse historical sources to build a coherent narrative of urban topology configuration. In a quantitative study of urban space and space syntax, enticing prospects as an exciting development of spaces use the city plan as the initial stage for investigating the historical relationship between the urban setting and urban life. The significant features of the axial line are with utilizing the argumentation of extrinsic spatial features in space syntax. DepthMap, open-source software for studying the visibility of urban core, was used in this study. The utilization of an axial map with a connection map is to frame basic facts in the study. Any strategy to revival or smart city development necessitates a full grasp of the spatial factors and stages that characterize our urban communities, as well as the link between the two. Consequently, this research uses axial analysis and visibility graph analysis to validate the degree of functionality of Kolkata’s Bag Bazar street over time as an input for digital preservation. The paper identifies the period having transformation for each attribute. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Digital Twin (DT) offers a novel framework to track, model, analyze, and anticipate complex urban processes and support data-driven decision-making. However, a premise of developing DT applications is to inventory physical urban built environment digitally, which are often lacking for small-and medium-sized cities due to limited resources. Particularly, few digital inventories have been built for urban curb environments, which have been increasingly challenged by new vehicle technologies and emerging mobility services. We propose a data-driven framework to inventory curb facilities across types and locations using computer vision (CV) and Google Street View (GSV) imagery. Specifically, we used a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model, i.e., DeepLab V3, pre-trained on the CityScapes dataset, to detect curb facilities of interest from GSV images. We then used the Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) to estimate the spatial location for each detected facility and used spatial processing to aggregate and filter estimation results. We demonstrated the framework for inventorying curbs in the Innovation District in the City of Gainesville, FL. The preliminary research contributes to Smart Curb Digital Twin for more safe, accessible, and productive curb environments. IEEE},

abstract={The Rehabilitation Engineering Association of North America has multiple published standards on wheelchair transportation safety and methods to test wheelchairs and related components when used as seats in automobiles. Similar to securement options in automobiles, the four-point tiedown system is the most common method of wheeled mobility device securement systems on transit buses. Staffed desks are most prevalent at transit stations and mass transportation terminals due to the concentration of travelers and increased demand for the customer service. The chapter discusses the mirror findings from Giampapa et al, which reviewed and assessed the potential for current technology research efforts to enhance accessible transportation in the reasonable future. Autonomous urban driving would dramatically increase access to spontaneous travel by people who cannot drive and create new options in regions poorly served by transit, and paratransit, or other forms of mass transportation. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Alex Mihailidis and Roger Smith.},

abstract={National-scale transportation systems are critical infrastructures to ensure the normal operation of the nation and offer essential services to modern societies. And they face a constant barrage of external stresses or threats that challenge their operation. This article analyzes the accessibility and vulnerability of the Chinese road, high-speed rail and airline systems. Firstly, it models the complementary relationship among road, high-speed rail and airline systems and takes them as an integrated transportation system (IRHAS). Then, the accessibility map from (to) the center of Beijing via IRHAS is displayed. Finally, modeling the extreme storm recently occurred in Zhengzhou as a reginal disruption, the vulnerability of the IRHAS is calculated. The findings in this paper provide guidance for city administrators to plan the road, high-speed rail, and airline systems as a whole. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The importance of human mobility analyses is growing in both research and practice, especially as applications for urban planning and mobility rely on them. Aggregate statistics and visualizations play an essential role as building blocks of data explorations and summary reports, the latter being increasingly released to third parties such as municipal administrations or in the context of citizen participation. However, such explorations already pose a threat to privacy as they reveal potentially sensitive location information, and thus should not be shared without further privacy measures. There is a substantial gap between state-of-the-art research on privacy methods and their utilization in practice. We thus conceptualize a mobility report with differential privacy guarantees and implement it as open-source software to enable a privacy-preserving exploration of key aspects of mobility data in an easily accessible way. Moreover, we evaluate the benefits of limiting user contributions using three data sets relevant to research and practice. Our results show that even a strong limit on user contribution alters the original geospatial distribution only within a comparatively small range, while significantly reducing the error introduced by adding noise to achieve privacy guarantees. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Navigation inside a closed area with no GNSS-signal accessibility is a highly challenging task. In order to tackle this problem, the Wi-Fi beacon-based methods have grabbed the attention of many researchers. However, it suffers from lack of accuracy and robustness against environmental changes and dynamic object movements. With the advancement of inference speed in real-time deep learning applications, in this paper, a multi-modal end-to-end system for large-scale indoor positioning has been proposed, namely Wi-Fi, CCTV and PDR integrated pedestrian positioning system, which increases positioning accuracy by overcoming the difficulties of environment changes. Firstly, a user request positioning and sends the detect access points (APs) and associated signal strength to a server. A Wi-Fi one-shot model is used to estimate an initial position for the user, then the nearby CCTV cameras are activated to detect and position pedestrians. A CCTV and PDR integrated particle filter is used to determine a valid correspondence to the user, simultaneously collecting Wi-Fi fingerprints from the user to passively update the Wi-Fi one-shot support set in real-time. By implementing the proposed system, we could achieve a highly accurate integrated indoor positioning with precision level of 0.3m. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Lately, the term accessibility attracts more attention globally in policy, but also in scientific and business terms. This is mainly triggered by two key reasons. The first one is its importance for the social performance of communities. Public are becoming more sensitive in social issues lately, and accessibility is considered a cornerstone towards this direction. Moreover, accessibility becomes essential towards sustainable development, due to its business importance. Efficiently handling accessibility issues and accommodating the special needs of people with disabilities may provide a robust business environment and substantial exploit market opportunities. To that end, the need for accessibility, especially in urban environments, is vital and ICT can play a key role towards enhancing accessibility. There are several tools and applications already available to serve this goal. This work presents a novel tool, namely the Seek & Go application, which is a holistic aid application for disabled people with features of a GPS navigation system, especially designed for pedestrians with mobility problems and special accessibility requirements. The paper briefly discusses the key technical aspects, while also presents user experience insights and description of the models and document schemas that have been selected for its development. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Ubiquitous accessibility worldwide and superior performance of cellular networks of communication like 4G and 5G make them a perfect candidate for air to ground (A2G) communications for low to medium altitude aircraft systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and urban air mobility (UAM). However, cellular networks are designed and optimized for terrestrial users, and employing them communication of cellular connected aerial vehicles such as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft flying at higher altitudes and faster speeds is accompanied with some issues which should be resolved prior to application. Too many handovers and following consequences such as radio link failures, longer delays, and degraded throughput are major issues in wider employment of cellular networks for A2G communications. In this paper we have considered two main issues of handover in LTE networks when used for A2G communications of cellular-connected aircraft and have proposed novel handover algorithms addressing these issues which will decrease the number of unnecessary and ping pong handovers, as well as radio link failure rate for cellular connected aircraft. The improved performance of the proposed algorithms has been verified by extensive simulations in a bespoke designed simulation model for cellular connected aircraft served by LTE networks. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Rapid improvements in real-world accessibility conditions have enabled greater mobility of people with disabilities as well as senior citizens. Such accessibility information is updated by local volunteers, which leads to further accessibility improvement and community revitalization through the activities of a wide variety of people. However, maintaining the continual activities of these volunteer groups is not always possible, and various regions have various efforts underway. By categorizing these efforts, it is possible to obtain knowledge that leads to effective and sustainable community assessments by local volunteers and to develop a support system for such assessments and collaboration measures. Therefore, this study aimed to categorize the needs and methods of various town tours and strolls (Machi-aruki in Japanese). Based on the holistic multiple case study framework, we first interviewed people who have practiced town tours and strolls in the urban educational district (Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan). Next, we summarized the details and informatization needs of town tours and strolls. The results indicated that the town tours and strolls were generally conducted for the unified or combined purposes of investigation, sightseeing, and interaction. Also, the needs and expectations for the use of information systems for town tours and strolls can be summarized as three items: prior confirmation of the route, synchronization of information and interactions acquired from the onsite to the online environment, and support for recalling, structuring, and visualizing information related to the map. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={From 2014, the European Commission established guidelines for drafting the SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan), defined as “a strategic plan to meet the varied mobility demand of people and businesses in urban and peri-urban areas in order to improve the quality of life in cities”. More recently, BiciPlans were introduced as mandatory for municipalities over 100,000 inhabitants to reduce car travel in favor of bicycles, both for daily needs and for tourist and recreational activities. Since there is no legislation regulating bicycle and pedestrian paths outside urban areas, and more specifically in the mountains, a methodology to identify their characteristics is here described. It takes into account accessibility by public transport, interconnection with other routes, services available along or close to the routes, historical and natural value of the itineraries and the classification of mountain trails carried out by the Italian Alpine Club (CAI). The methodology, implemented in the free and open source QGIS, leads to the identification of four classes of paths: tourist level, good, very good and high technical capacity. Its application to the Genoa Forts system, due to their historical and architectural value, highlights its applicability and usefulness in supporting the fruition of the area under study. Finally, a webGIS allows the proposal to be shared with local government technicians and end users. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Implementing destination operations in a confined area may be revolutionized by indoor localization if the current inadequacies can be solved. Consequently, the development of a widespread indoor localization system (ILS) is now required. Cell phones and Internet-based indoor navigation could be used to achieve widespread use because cellphones are widely available and most buildings have WiFi. WiFi signal strength varies greatly depending on the environment and the configuration of the devices that use it. Because of this, a universal ILS that is widely accessible and does not need specialist hardware support remains a long way off in the future. Thus, this research examines the current level of WiFi-based algorithms for indoor positioning and their potential to be used in a wide variety of contexts. As a result, an ILS that relies on WiFi for availability is the fundamental objective of this study, and it aims to identify and recommend future research priorities. Using a real-world dataset, some experiments have been done to show how hard it is to put this kind of system into place. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The Constantine tramway line in Algeria has many variables that can be analysed to assess the impact of the line. These variables include social ones, such as the rational supply of transport between different modes of travel, the place of people with reduced mobility in the supply and interior and exterior design. Moreover, the economic variables that are the most dominant in relation to its importance in the development of the economy of the city are the reliability and comfort made to the regularity of the transport time in relation to time savings and intermodality at stopping points. To this end, this article examines these different variables during several commissioning periods in order to determine the impact of the introduction of the tramway line in the Constantine metropolitan area. Its approach is carried out through a field survey, interviews and on-site observations with a population made up of users of different travel modes. The results confirm that the tramway line linking the city of Constantine and the new town of Ali Mendjeli has a strong effect on ridership. On the other hand, its effects seem minimal in terms of rational supply and intermodality between different travel modes. Meanwhile, reliability and regularity are topics that deserve to be explored. The accessibility of people with reduced mobility is considered a primary objective of the tramway system. © 2022 Silesian University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Metropolitan Area of São Paulo is the main Brazilian urban region, where approximately 21 million people generate 42 million trips daily being 54% by Public Transportation. This paper aims is to investigate how transport attributes affect the way of commuters use Public Transportation. To do so, a model using the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) a multi-criteria decision was established. We used six criteria: Environment; Safety; Cost; Accessibility; Confort and Speed and five alternatives: Bus, Metropolitan Train, Subway, Ridesharing, and Bike-sharing. The results showed an advantage for Bike-sharing (34.9%), Metropolitan Train (23.5%), Subway (23%), Bus (10.4%), and finally Ridesharing (8%). © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Urban mobility is related to public transport system planning, geographic city size, economic power, and the ability to manage the resources of each city. In Brazil, cities are obliged by law to create an urban mobility plan, but they really work? How Brazilian state capitals are acting to face the challenges to provide an efficient urban mobility plan? This paper aims to evaluate urban mobility considering infrastructure, quality of services, cost and fares, accessibility, environment and safety in Brazilian cities. To do so, we selected a sample of thirteen state capitals and data were collected from Urban Mobility Information System. The analysis was made using graphs and cross-tabulation. Our results show that the sample cities prioritize road transport systems, the fleet of vehicles requires modernization, and it is missing investment in dedicated bus lanes to have a more agile and efficient transport system. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Urban sprawl has been a persistent sustainability impediment caused by its associated low urban density that led to heavy reliance on private cars. To overcome this problem, urban densification, as a sustainable planning approach, has been widely advocated. Al Ain, one of the most affected cities by urban sprawl in the United Arab Emirates, has recently adopted an urban densification process through its Al Ain Plan 2030 and started applying it by 2010 in a pioneering redevelopment project in Bida Bin Ammar neighborhood. This research aims at studying the impacts of the applied urban densification measures and tools on social sustainability in this neighborhood. The research adopts a qualitative case study method utilizing field observations as the main source of primary data collection, while the analysis of CAD drawings, census data, land-use plans, and Google Earth maps forms a secondary source of data for this study. Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that urban densification through its two applied measures, the Intensification and the Infill Development, have enhanced social sustainability in Bida Bin Ammar neighborhood but with various degrees of success for each of the social sustainability principle and indicators. While mixed use and accessibility principles have been partially enhanced in the study area, density, mobility, social capital, quality of life, sense of belonging, and safety and security have been weakly enhanced. Accordingly, a proposed set of guidelines have been initiated to inform decision-makers in the city, and maybe in other cities in the UAE and the Arabian Gulf region, to help them revise the applied urban densification process in a way that helps achieve more socially sustainable urban communities. © 2022, Ubiquity Press.

Accurate urban weather data requires a robust, autonomous and reliable sensing, modeling and data processing systems capable of detecting and communicating weather hazards in near-real time. TruWeather Solutions (TWS) is addressing wind challenges that impact small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) airframes. TWS with several partners were awarded NASA projects to develop three services dependent upon data collected from sensing infrastructure deployed in an urban weather testbed. These services range from optimally placing sensors, flagging off-nominal data and detecting wind hazards based on high-resolution scans. Copyright © 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society.

abstract={Global Positioning System (GPS) has benefited many novel applications, <italic>e.g.</italic>, navigation, ride-sharing, and location-based services, in our daily life. Although GPS works well in most places, its performance in urban canyons is well-known poor, due to the signal reflections of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) satellites. Tremendous efforts have been made to mitigate the impacts of NLOS signals, while previous works heavily rely on precise proprietary 3D city models or other third-party resources, which are not easily accessible. In this paper, we present <italic>DeepGPS</italic> , a deep learning enhanced GPS positioning system that can correct GPS estimations by only considering some simple contextual information. <italic>DeepGPS</italic> fuses environmental factors, including building heights and road distribution around GPS&#x0027;s initial position, and satellite statuses to describe the positioning context, and exploits an encoder-decoder network model to implicitly learn the complex relationships between positioning contexts and GPS estimations from massive labeled GPS samples. As a result, the well-trained model can accurately predict the correct position for each erroneous GPS estimation given its positioning context. We further improve the model with a novel constraint mask to filter out invalid candidate locations, and enable continuous localization with a simple mobility model. A prototype system is implemented and experimentally evaluated using a large-scale bus trajectory dataset and real-field GPS measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that <italic>DeepGPS</italic> significantly enhances GPS performance in urban canyons, <italic>e.g.</italic>, on average effectively correcting 90.1&#x0025; GPS estimations with accuracy improvement by 64.6&#x0025;.

abstract={Simulation models generate an abundance of rich raw data that remains difficult to access for non-experts. However, such data could be unlocked and utilised with a Semantic City Planning System that improves data accessibility and transparency. This paper describes a process of ontologically representing mobility simulation output data using Semantic Web technologies and storing it in a dynamic geospatial knowledge graph. Our work presents two benefits: 1) formally representing simulation output data increases the accessibility and transparency of urban simulation models, and 2) access to under-utilised rich data unlocks novel cross-domain knowledge explorations and research possibilities. We demonstrate these benefits by means of cross-domain queries related to typical city planning questions. © 2022, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

abstract={Smart mobility is a sustainable mobility system that is fully interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT) and a seamless intermodal operation for passenger and goods transport. The characterization of sustainability is not straightforward, and several indicators and metrics (key performance indicators [KPI]) exist. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) created the Sustainable Mobility Project (SMP2.0), which consists of 19 indicators to monitor the evolution of a country/urban region or compare the mobility of several cities. Those indicators include fatalities, accessibility to public transport within walking distance, energy efficiency, global warming impact, air quality pollution, and commuting time. SMP2.0 was applied to two European regions (Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas) to help understand the complexity of such metrics and what lessons can be learned. Smart mobility criteria were applied to Lisbon city's new bicycle-sharing system, and its impacts on energy consumption and emissions were explored. Traditional fossil energy sources are fueling the European Union (EU) transport system (maritime, aviation, and road) and the electricity generation (average 60%) for railways transport. The transition to bio-jet and bio-maritime fuel from new biorefinery systems coupled with the electrification of the light-duty fleet will have impacts on the sustainable mobility indicators. Some of these indicators, such as ground-level ozone (O3) and greenhouse gas (GHG) savings, are impacted in unexpected ways. The EU electricity target for full decarbonization until 2050 (0â€‰gCO2eq /kWh) will foster changes in the mobility indicators' values. The earth's material depletion is becoming an important KPI, and the mobility system must adapt to the stringiest sustainability criteria. © 2022 WILEY-VCH GmbH, Boschstr. 12, 69469 Weinheim, Germany.

abstract={Inner and marginal areas, territories usually identified in the context of rural and mountainous regions with low accessibility levels, are characterized by low population density and depopulation. The concept of “inner” or “marginal” areas embraces a set of different settlement conditions. Italy’s definition of Inner Areas focuses on rural areas characterized by the distance from the main service centres (education, health and mobility). It is clear that one of the key elements is accessibility, availability of adequate transport systems. The functional layout of the road network, heavily influenced by the orographic and geological characteristics of the territory, substantially affects the affordability and quality of the transport supply. To ensure quality of services in such areas, transport service supply has to be improved on the base of non-conventional, on demand and flexible mobility systems, to improve widespread accessibility and urban-rural connectivity. An experimental extensive plan of action interesting the inner areas of Italy is being implemented through the “National Strategy for Inner Areas”, where the accessibility plays an important role and in that sense the transport network is redesigned in an integrated way with the territorial development scenario and in the perspective to guarantee access to essential services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In Mozambique, extreme weather events have a measurable impact on social and economic growth. Triggered by cyclones and intense rain events, floods have become more frequent in recent years and are expected to follow this trend due to climate change. Recently, major floods following the passage of cyclones Idai and Kenneth (2019) caused 603 fatalities, leaving 1641 people injured and 2.5 million people in need of humanitarian aid, of which 1.3 million were children. At the capital, Maputo, and the surrounding cities and districts (Matola, Marracuene, and Boane) that form the Greater Maputo Area (GMA) accessibility to jobs, health, and education facilities for the poorest population is one of the lowest in Africa, with one-third of public transport users reporting that flooding hinders their access to jobs during rainy days. A methodical investigation of flood risk for the existing road network in Matola and Maputo has been conducted in the framework of a major urban development project planned by the Government of Mozambique. Assessment of flood hazard has been carried out in GIS using the Flood Hazard Index framework based on geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, and geographical criteria, as well as inventorying of historic floods. To account for climate change, baseline calculations are compared with projections up to 2040. The analysis has considered the exposure of the population in addition to the geospatial distribution of the primary and secondary road network. Socioeconomic parameters relevant to poverty and the presence of vulnerable groups have been considered for the estimation of human vulnerability. The paper presents a novel implementation of the INFORM risk indexing framework for the analysis of flood-induced transportation disruptions in a region where the humanitarian impact of such events can be disproportionate. The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for an equity-centred prioritization of climate adaptation interventions to enhance the resilience and inclusivity of urban transport systems in GMA. © 2022, National Technical University of Athens.

abstract={Fostering urban and interurban bicycle mobility is a priority for cities in order to cope with net-zero emissions' mandates that arise in the near future. However, authorities and municipalities in charge of developing the underlying structures for this means of transport are lacking suitable tools to gather and visualise real-time mobility data with which these authorities or businesses could make better decisions towards the design and maintenance of bicycle infrastructure. At the same time, the developments described in this article are part of the Deustek research group's work leading up to the SOCIO-BEE project, which seeks to encourage the participation of citizens in decision-making on policies related to the environmental improvement of our territory. Therefore, this article seeks to provide public administrations, private companies, researchers and entrepreneurs with a web service that visualises environmental-quality and mobility data. The tools and framework developed aim to provide information to citizens that will help them to better understand the existent mobility dynamics, and thus develop actions that will foster bicycle transportation in any city context. To this extent, the design and implementation of an open -source mobility data web service is provided. This service is connected to a web-accessible central system that stores both environmental-quality and mobility data, allowing the correct visualisation of collected measurements. Furthermore, the proposal is provided with an embedded system capable of gathering mobility and environmental-quality data while it's attached to any given bicycle. This enables the web service's users both the inspection of the actual track of the bicycle they own or have rented as well as the understanding of the different environmental key parameters of their route related to air or noise pollution. Initial findings have been obtained from testing the application in the bike renting system offered by the city of Bilbao, Spain © 2022 University of Split, FESB.},

abstract={The accessibility level of urban areas depends on the attractiveness of the zone and its reachability degree. The former is affected by settled activities; the latter depends on features of the supply system. From a sustainable perspective, one of the key strategies is promoting the use of active modes and micro-mobility options. In this context, the paper aims to investigate the variations in student accessibility (i.e., passive accessibility) due to the adoption of a micro-mobility solution. To show the feasibility of the proposed approach, it has been applied in the case of university plexuses in the Fuorigrotta district (Naples, Italy). Simulation results confirm that such solutions increase the accessibility level and show that they are preferred by users as first/last mile options, as well as for replacing pedestrian trips. Moreover, the provided outcome reveals the effectiveness of the proposed methodology as a Decision Support System (DSS) for helping micro-mobility operators to design service features. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Enabling the elderly to live independently and to maintain their quality of life at home for as long as possible constitutes a major public health challenge, especially in rural and semi-urban environments where the access to formal care may be difficult. Tracking and activity monitoring allows to detect when skills for daily activities are going down to provide timely treatments and avoid future complications. This work presents an IoT system based on a wearable prototype intended for indoor and outdoor tracking and physical activity monitoring of dementia patients in remote locations. For this purpose, the wearable developed makes use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for outdoor tracking, a developed indoor symbolic location system based on infrared signals, a step detector using an accelerometer and LoRaWAN communications. Positioning information is presented to caregivers or healthcare staff through an accessible web platform, which allows the visualization of the trajectories followed by patients over the last few weeks, together with information about room occupancy in indoor environments and physical activity. These data can be used to detect anomalous changes in daily patients' routines or to know the user's position in cases where the patient may have become disoriented. The proposed system encourages the autonomy of dementia patients and allows information about the disease's progression to be extracted. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Accessibility and usability have been key concerns in the design of computer interfaces through which users interact with an application or a system. In developing CAPRIO, our personalized path recommendation system, usability was a design principle for its interface and accessibility was central in its path-finding algorithm, which currently considers user mobility constraints. Motivated by the recent discussions on algorithm biases as well as diversity and inclusion, we have examined the meaning of accessibility under the lens of inclusion and its role in enhancing CAPRIO's development. In this vision paper we discuss how a system like CAPRIO can become fully inclusive that it benefits users from all backgrounds. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, an efficient ultra-wideband technology based indoor positioning system is developed to improve the measurement accuracy of a mecanum wheeled mobile robot. Data processing structure of the system is created using Monte Carlo - Latin Hypercube Sampling based machine learning algorithm. Monte Carlo - Latin Hypercube Sampling method can be used to perform the position estimation since it enables the range of each variable is fully accessible. This makes the algorithm outputs more accurate and reliable and thus increases correctness in measurements. An experimental setup including hardware, software and mathematical model is developed. A number of experiments are conducted to validate the indoor positioning system proposed. Efficiency, accuracy and precision of methodology are also tested in the experimental studies. The adaptation of the algorithm in a real system and the field tests are also conducted using a four-mecanum-wheeled mobile robot. The experimental studies show that the position estimation is improved by more than 20% using the proposed algorithm compared to the methods presented in the literature. © 2022 The Franklin Institute},

abstract={This study is devoted to ways of forming routes taking into account external natural and artificial factors, and the perception of such factors by the traveler. The route is built based on preliminary knowledge of an area and is updated with information obtained during travel. Orientation along the route is carried out using signs (waymarks, billboards) and other natural and artificial references which clarify preliminary knowledge of the area. The final and intermediate targets along the route are determined by spatial objects—“points of interest” or “points of attraction”—which are either chosen in advance or occur unpredictably during movement along the route. At the same time, the available accuracy, completeness and degree of relevance of local maps do not always provide the information necessary for travelers. The interface of route creation acts as an intermediary between the preliminary idea of the route and the observable external environment. The interface can supplement incomplete or unavailable information; it helps to search for appropriate objects based on given attributes. Currently digital applications are often used as such interfaces. Objects on the route are constantly changing their properties over time—both according to a previously known schedule and as a result of random events. The appearance of unexpected obstacles, and sudden changes in lighting and weather conditions, force travelers to significantly change their routes and choose new route options. The framework can be used both for optimizing navigation and tourism services and for preparing project designs for landscaping and development of suburban terrains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In line with the leading European directives, i.e. the Sustainable Goals of the 2030 Agenda, concerning urban development and emissions reduction, the authors find in the 15-min city a model that prioritises active mobility as the main way to reach services within a neighbourhood. The paper is based on the concept of the Smart City (SC), which is defined as a city capable of serving and integrating the demands of individual citizens while concentrating on sustainability and hence on environmentally friendly lifestyles. In this context, the paper highlights pedestrian and bicycle accessibility in relation to essential services, by considering the San Benedetto neighbourhood in the city of Cagliari as a case study. The pedestrian accessibility to essential services is measured in a range of influences based on home-service travel times between 5 and 15 min, using a GIS tool. The contribution aims at identifying action plans for implementing local mobility strategies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Indoor localization and tracking plays a vital role in the IoT field for its various types of applications, e.g. healthcare system, pedestrian navigation, emergency rescue. Among all the available sensors, the combination of IMU and WiFi-RSS is the most widely used scheme for its low cost and pedestrian compatibility. However, conventional indoor localization systems cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. To cope with this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization system that integrates the IMU sensing and the RSS fingerprinting via a proposed PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) based algorithm. We develop a new WiFi-enabled platform which can obtain RSS from captured wireless messages in the WiFi traffic. Based on this platform, the RSS fingerprints and the displacement estimated by IMU serve as the guidance and soft constraints for the particle swarm. A fitness metric is also proposed to evaluate the likelihood of each particle finding the real position by incorporating the GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) method. To improve the localization accuracy, we leverage the layout of the map, which provides information on accessible and inaccessible areas. Besides, image processing techniques including line detection and contour extraction are utilized to constrain the particles that may fall into the inaccessible areas. Experiments are conducted in a multiple function laboratory and the results verify that the proposed approach outperforms the typical approaches, and the achieved mean localization error is 0.705m. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce and propose a wind-aware small unmanned aircraft system human-in-the-loop simulation pipeline for operations in low-altitude urban airspace. To complement the Urban Air Mobility concept that envisions safe, sustainable, and accessible air transportation, we design an aggregated simulation pipeline so that Human Machine Interaction during operations in turbulent windy conditions can be studied. In this work, we primarily identify the lack of wind-awareness in the current user interface designs available for small unmanned aircraft system. After a small research group study, we recognize the information components that are crucial in the operational context and integrate specific display information in an extended wind-aware user interface which includes real time wind velocity display and trajectory management features. Additionally, we extend the capability of an existing simulator to simulate spatial-temporal wind data in real time. The simulation pipeline provides a comprehensive structure for wind-aware sUAS simulations which can be used for mission design experiments in the presence of wind and evaluation of pilot response to increased wind situational awareness. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={Finding barrier-free accessible path through the built environment is necessary for wheelchair users. Researchers have identified the effect of surface vibration on the health of wheelchair users and proposed various solutions to identify and annotate mobility barriers. However, the effects of surface-induced vibration on accessibility is yet to be investigated. In order to address this problem, we present the WheelShare system which uses machine learning to identify surfaces and curbs from vibration captured by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (both smartphone and wearable device). WheelShare allows users to share their collected data via crowd-sourcing. Based on this surface-specific vibration we recognize 32 different surfaces found across the built environment (in Austria, China, France, Germany, India, and the USA for 32 human subjects) with an accuracy of 97.5&#x0025;. The recognized surfaces are then grouped into different categories based on their characteristics. Our novel contributions in this paper include the following. (1) We have developed a machine learning enabled surface recognition system which uses sensor data to capture surface-induced vibration patterns. (2) We have tested the robustness of the system for devices with only accelerometer data (such as low-end smartphones) and achieved an accuracy of 91.6&#x0025;. (3) We have deployed our prototype WheelShare system for real-time surface classification in new sites that are unseen in training and testing, and successfully recognized the surface characteristics.

abstract={With today's automotive industry shifting towards Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), infrastructure within the urban transportation systems need to be addressed to ensure optimal operations of CAVs in U.S. cities. This project sought to provide technology investment recommendations for new and modified infrastructure to city officials and staff to support U.S. cities as they prepare for the deployment of CAVs. Analysis and recommendations were based on two case studies of major intersections in the cities of Miami, Florida, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. These case studies showcased different types of roadways and intersection users. Using peer-reviewed research on city infrastructure, policies and regulations, available sensor technologies, and vehicle operations, alternative roadway and IT system specifications were designed with the intention of reducing vehicular accidents, improving traffic flow, improving sensor functionality, and ensuring accessibility to intersection users. Possible design elements included Modified Lanes, Mobility Hubs, Digital Transportation Management System (DTMS), and Improved Lighting System. Prototyping, subject matter expert interviews, and peer-reviewed research were used to determine the validity of the components in the designs. The feedback from the testing phase was analyzed to guide iterations of the analytical prototypes to ensure that the design follows regulations and policies, while also focusing on safety, traffic flow, and accessibility. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Traveling independently to unknown buildings is difficult for people with disabilities, as there is a lack of information about accessibility of indoor environments. In particular, there are hardly any freely available indoor maps of public buildings. In this paper, we address the problem that there is no comprehensive list of information relevant to people with disabilities in indoor environments, which in turn can be used for indoor orientation and navigation systems. We therefore collected in an extensive literature review around 820 indoor accessibility features relevant for people with disabilities. These were categorized and sorted in a database and mapped to OSM and A11yJSON. The database is publicly available and can serve as a basis for tag proposals to OSM, and as Linked Data (RDF). © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Indoor positioning is critical for applications like navigation, tracking, monitoring, and accessibility. For the visually impaired this has a huge implication on independent mobility for accessing all types of services as well as social inclusion. The unavailability of indoor positioning solutions with adequate accuracy is a major constraint. The key reason for the lack of growth in indoor positioning systems is to do with the reliability of indoor positioning techniques and additional infrastructure costs along with maintenance overheads. We propose a novel single camera-based visual positioning solution for indoor spaces. Our method uses smart visual feature selection and matching in real-time using a monocular camera. We record and transform the video route information into spars and invariant point-based SURF features. To limit the real-time feature search and match data, the routes inside the buildings are broken into a connected graph. To find the position, confidence of a path increases if it founds a good feature match and decreases otherwise. Each query frame uses a K-nearest neighbor match with the existing databases to increase the confidence of matched path in subsequent frames. Results have shown a reliable positioning accuracy of ∼ 2 meters in variable lighting conditions. We also investigated the error recovery of positioning systems where it easily re-positions the user within the neighboring edges. To promote crowdsourcing, proposed system can add more visual features to the database while performing the matching task. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Before visiting a new location, we often look at maps to build an a priori mental representation of the environment using landmarks and points of interest. No such options are easily available for persons with visual impairment (PVIs). As a result, PVIs are often dependent on others for assistance with any activities that require visiting unfamiliar spaces. This seriously constrains PVIs’ social inclusion and ability and right to independently explore their environment. From our earlier studies with experienced PVIs, we explored existing way-finding strategies and the role of environmental cues in aiding orientation and mobility. Here, we build on these findings to propose a route preview assistance application for PVIs to improve building orientation by helping to create a mental representation of spaces they are planning to visit. We translated non-visual cues into potential landmarks and encoded them into a mapping tool - IncluMap. The mapped building data is used to generate an aural route preview. In the follow-up study with five PVI participants, we evaluated how route preview assistance can improve orientation and route knowledge. We show that even for longer routes (&gt;50 m) with a relatively good number of cognitive landmarks (&gt;5), participants were able to remember and build a mental map. We found cognitive landmarks were useful for PVIs to support re-localization and getting reassurance in complex indoor spaces. Based on these findings we believe that the proposed route preview assistance can be a useful tool to provide orientation and mobility training to PVIs. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays, a great amount of information is communicated in visual form. This excludes visually impaired people from easily accessing that information. A consequence is that they tend to limit their mobility due to lack of information. The goal of this work is to make indoor maps more accessible to help blind people preparing a trip to unknown buildings. In our approach, we further developed an interactive audio-tactile system to facilitate access to indoor maps. A study with blind participants showed that the prototype was well accepted and easy to use. The participants were able to achieve accurate mental models of the provided maps. A further comparison with sighted participants using visual maps showed no significant differences in the ability to describe the maps. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={For people with disabilities, indoor routing approaches have to take the specific requirements of the target user group into account. Depending on the needs of the individual, certain objects and indoor features can present insurmountable barriers and hence, should be avoided when generating indoor routes. Research in the field of indoor routing for people with disabilities has been going on for several years, but most approaches focus on one specific disability and do not evaluate designed systems with the target user group. Therefore, we propose an accessible, adaptable indoor routing algorithm for people with disabilities. The designed system is evaluated in a user study with people with blindness and mobility impairments using a Wizard of Oz approach. Results indicate a good acceptance of the designed routing system. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper proposes a context-aware model for a mobile indoor navigation system in which users’ needs play a key role. We will present an overview of the underlying architecture, describe the main data involved, and show how they are used; we will especially focus on the role of the users’ preferences and accessibility needs, since they are the key elements that allow to build a personalized and inclusive user experience. Thanks to a service-oriented architecture, a mobile application will be able to retrieve the most adequate information for its user about a specific point of interest in the environment, and issue a personalized notification. Examples of interaction with the system from the perspective of back-end operators will also be provided, in which we will show how the model entities are translated into practice during the configuration phase of the system. We will pay particular attention to the case of visually impaired users, for whom accessible navigation apps have proven to be effective assistive solutions to achieve better social inclusion and autonomy. We will assume to be using BLE beacons and an Android mobile app for our simulations, anyway we will show that our model is generalizable. Finally, future possible enhancements of the system will be discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the advent of technology and algorithms in image processing, many wearable aides are available in the market, and researchers across the globe are developing new solutions. The existing solutions and products fail to provide an economically viable and single solution to the problem of visually impaired people. This study introduces AIde, a novel system amalgamating optimized computer vision algorithms and wearable IoT devices to convert the information extracted from the camera mounted on the user to audio-based signals for assisted mobility. The proposed system has three user modes: indoor, outdoor, and hybrid, which can be modified using the buttons provided on the wearable device. The indoor mode can be used for object detection and classification to increase the accessibility of the objects inside a confined space, and the outdoor mode will provide the user with enhanced mobility and directional sense based on the highlighted path captured by the mounted camera. The hybrid model combines both the features of indoor and outdoor modes, which will detect objects and improve mobility simultaneously. The proposed model is optimized to work in a computationally efficient environment with an at par efficiency and accuracy as the state-of-art and costly market alternatives. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Variable traffic conditions cause travel time uncertainty and further lead to time-varying accessibility. Most current studies do not fully consider fluctuations in accessibility and use complicated methods that likely overestimate the level of accessibility and hinder the application of accessibility measures. To address this issue, we utilized large-scale open-source data and proposed an interpretation of the reliability of accessibility concept that incorporates reliability, travel time uncertainty, and a cumulative opportunity measure. We examined the reliability of accessibility to Shenzhen, a major city in China, focusing on transit accessibility and job opportunities. The results demonstrate that the reliability of accessibility displays a bimodal distribution along urban railway lines and can be used to calculate the impact of urban railways in terms of punctuality. The new approach illustrates time-varying characteristics in the form of probabilities and provides further guidance on accessibility for governments. © 2022 Zhongsheng Xiao et al.},

abstract={Waterfront communities are facing unprecedented challenges with global Sea Level Rise (SLR) becoming a reality. The households in these communities are likely to be inundated, and the inundation of links in the urban transportation system will bring more interruptions to the communities. Some residents will not be able to access their workplaces or education if the transportation system is interrupted. Among these waterfront communities, many are considered disadvantaged communities that have concentrations of minority and low-income families. Residents in these communities are more vulnerable because they tend to be less able to relocate to other neighborhoods with lower risks of SLR. Many of the proposed protection strategies against SLR are at regional levels, and their goals are usually to achieve the greater good for the whole region. However, the distribution of the benefits or burdens may be unequal across different communities. The present paper utilizes detailed hydrodynamic simulation and activity-based transportation simulation to quantify the impact of potential protection strategies on different communities. The San Francisco Bay Area is the geographical region analyzed. Important insights from the analysis are obtained: improvements of mobility, resulting from protecting the shore of the West Bay, are often less in disadvantaged communities than others. A great proportion of disadvantaged communities are negatively impacted by the protection strategy that brings benefits to the whole region. Additional measures should be taken on relieving these disadvantaged communities to reduce transportation inequality. © 2022, Jordan University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the problem of visual indoor navigation to an object that is defined by its semantic category. Recent works have shown significant achievements in the end-to-end reinforcement learning approach and modular systems. However, both approaches need a big step forward to be robust and practically applicable. To solve the problem of insufficient exploration of the scenes and make exploration more semantically meaningful, we extend standard task formulation and give the agent easily accessible landmarks in the form of the room locations and those types. The availability of landmarks allows the agent to build a hierarchical policy structure and achieve a success rate of 63% on validation scenes in a photo-realistic Habitat simulator. In a hierarchy, a low level consists of separately trained RL skills and a high level deterministic policy, which decides which skill is needed at the moment. Also, in this paper, we show the possibility of transferring a trained policy to a real robot. After a bit of training on the reconstructed real scene, the robot shows up to 79% SPL when solving the task of navigating to an arbitrary object. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Knowledge of route accessibility is indispensable for “wheeled mobility device” users to travel safely and efficiently; however, current navigation technologies hardly provide adapted information for this population. Aims of the study were to collect data on the usability of a navigation application and to propose a version 1.0 of the Evaluation of satisfaction with geospatial assistive technology (ESGAT), by addressing the criterion, construct and cross-cultural validities. Method: A filmed field trial and a methodological study were conducted in parallel. Thirty wheeled mobility device users were filmed planning and making a 10-minute known journey using the HERE WeGo app. The ESGAT, ÉSTGA (French version) and the Computer System Usability Questionnaire were administered. A video observation grid addressed the effectiveness and efficiency during the journey. Descriptive, correlation and multiple match analyses were performed. Results: Fourteen men and 16 women averaging 45.9 years old tried out HERE WeGo; 14 were powered wheelchair users. Usability of the app was moderate (good effectiveness, moderate efficiency and quite satisfied). The criterion validity of the ÉSTGA was good (r = 0.598; p < 0.001). The construct validity was average considering the results for factor 1 (α = 0.789, acceptable), factor 2 (α = 0,586, low) and factor 3 (α = 0.409, unacceptable). The cross-cultural validity (French vs English) was moderate (r = 0.861; p < 0.001). Conclusion: ESGAT and ÉSTGA 1.0 questionnaires are now available in English and French with a total mean score (11 items), an informatics subscore (mean of 5 items) and a geomatic subscore (mean of 6 items). Their validation should be pursued with new navigation applications. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Clinicians should ask their clients using a wheeled mobility device to test navigation applications to ensure their safety and complete the Evaluation of satisfaction with geospatial assistive technology (ESGAT 1.0), also available in French. Clinicians should inquire about satisfaction for items addressing informatics (Ease of access, Learnability, Hands-free function, Ease of use, Transportability and Appearance) and items addressing geomatic (Content, Geographic information, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Real-time navigation assistance, Aspect of security). Rehabilitation clinicians should inquire about the efficiency of the navigation app, considering avoiding or announcing potential obstacles such as: travelling on the street for a long portion of the trip and not on the sidewalk; verbal indication too soon or too late; incorrect indication; damaged, and congested sidewalk. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={COVID-19 has caused havoc on educational systems around the globe, impacting over 2 billion learners in over 200 countries. University, college, and other institutional facility cutbacks have impacted more than 94% of the world’s largest population of students. As a result, enormous changes have occurred in every aspect of human life. Social distance and mobility restrictions have significantly altered conventional educational procedures. Because numerous new standards and procedures have been adopted, restarting classrooms once the restrictions have been withdrawn seems to be another issue. Many scientists have published their findings on teaching and learning in various ways in the aftermath of the COVID-19 epidemic. Face-to-face instruction has been phased out in a number of schools, colleges, and universities. There is concern that the 2021 academic year, or perhaps more in the future, will be lost. Innovation and implementation of alternative educational systems and evaluation techniques are urgently needed. The COVID-19 epidemic has given us the chance to lay the groundwork for digital learning. The goal of this article is to provide a complete assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on e-learning and learning multiple papers, as well as to suggest a course of action. This study also emphasises the importance of digital transformation in e-learning as well as the significant challenges it confronts, such as technological accessibility, poor internet connectivity, and challenging study environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to vastly improve independent, safe, and cost-effective mobility options for individuals with disabilities. However, accessibility considerations are often overlooked in the early stages of design, resulting in AVs that are inaccessible to people with disabilities. Vehicles serving people with disabilities typically require costly aftermarket modifications for accessibility, which may have unforeseen impacts on vehicle performance and safety, particularly in the case of automated vehicles. In this research, we investigate the performance of three autonomous shuttle design configurations: an off-the-shelf shuttle that is not wheelchair accessible, the campus pilot shuttle that is wheelchair accessible, and a new design using wheelchair accessibility foresight. Physics-based simulations performed using MATLAB, ADAMS (Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems), and Autonomie demonstrated that the modifications aimed at providing wheelchair access had important implications for vehicle dynamics (e.g., turning radius, pitch, roll), energy consumption (operating range and usage duration), and cost per passenger. A ride comfort analysis was performed using MATLAB to study the passenger's ride comfort in all three shuttle designs. Energy consumption and lateral dynamic analyses were performed to analyze the operating range and turning radius of the shuttles. Also a brief cost analysis provides insight into the cost implications of post-production modifications. Simulation results indicate aftermarket modifications have a large impact on the vehicle performance and increase the cost per passenger. The campus pilot shuttle design adversely affects the turning radius and reduces the driving range by 38% while the new design makes no compromises in vehicle dynamics or driving range. We conclude that if wheelchair access and related accessibility considerations are incorporated in the design phase, the adverse performance of aftermarket modifications can be avoided. ©},

funding_text 1={This paper uses the case study of a project carried out in 2019, which was aimed toward introducing an innovative shared AV transportation system to the Western Michigan University (WMU) campus. In this deployment, two low-speed electric automated shuttles, modified post-production, operate on a fixed route within the campus. The case study is used to describe experiences related to incorporating accessibility considerations for wheeled mobility device users and to showcase the availability of wheelchair-accessible automated electric shuttles. The project was supported through the Michigan Mobility Challenge, a program designed by the Michigan Department of Transportation to fund pilot transportation projects that solve mobility challenges for seniors, persons with disabilities, and veterans throughout Michigan. This paper describes the process of generating target design specifications and the modifications made to achieve the current design of the deployed shuttle. In addition, this paper also analyzes an ideal scenario where a similar autonomous shuttle is designed with accessibility considerations from the onset.},

abstract={After 14 years since its first implementation of high-speed rail, the Korean government decided to develop its own model for the Hyperloop in 2017. This study is part of the effort and designed to examine the overall HSR network of South Korea. Out of 38 variables, 5 were selected to conduct a modelling process for an Hypertube Express (HTX). Two HTX networks were drawn and compared based on anticipated construction costs, suitability scores, and detailed information. The ‘X’ network is intended to provide the maximum accessibility to regional population centres but the speed would be slower due to its short distance between stations. On the other hands, the ‘O’ network gives less accessibility to a major city but designed to enjoy the maximum speed of an HTX as the route is the longest. The ‘X’ network will cost about $1,451 million less than the ‘O’ network for its initial construction. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Designing for professional, high-risk user contexts often implies limited accessibility for interaction designers to conduct field research and field testing, and the measures taken by most universities in Norway in 2020 to prevent COVID-19 spread have further contributed to the problem of achieving the contextual insight needed throughout the design process by severely restricting travel for research purposes. In this paper, we describe the use of virtual reality-reconstructed operation scenarios (VRROS) for Arctic-going vessels implemented in support of and as a substitute for the contextual aspects of fieldwork in the education of master’s students studying interaction design. The virtual reality rig contains three scenarios contextualizing ships’ bridges and their surroundings originally developed for research on designing navigation and operation applications using augmented reality technology. We evaluate whether aspects of the VRROS can substitute for real fieldwork by evaluating students’ use of the VRROS using a student questionnaire. Finally, we discuss the value and potential of using VRROS as a supplement and support when studying how to design for hard-to-reach contexts in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Electric rickshaws’ operation is an environmentally sound and clean mode of transportation. University campuses have always been favored locations to emphasize sustainability and to help remodel society’s transportation systems. This study utilizes the electric rickshaws’ trip data collected in the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli (NITT), India, using perception and origin–destination surveys via in-person questionnaires. The study explores the travel demand and travel pattern of electric rickshaw riders inside the NITT campus. The aim of the study is to evaluate the various factors influencing the travel demand and pattern of electric rickshaws’. Also, an attempt is made to optimize the location of charging stations by minimizing the dead kilometre constraint. We find a higher demand for the electric rickshaws within the campus’ proximity, mainly for educational trips with an average trip frequency of 10 minutes. Results of the study imply that majority of the trip destination lies near the academic and administrative areas, where the charging stations need to be located. The findings from the survey would provide essential inputs for the planning of electric rickshaw services. Additionally, the study results can be used as a case-study example for strategically placing the charging stations in an educational campus. This type of transport mode would help promote sustainable mobility and accessibility within the campus. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Swedish cities are embracing shared micro-mobility systems (SMMS) such as e-scooters sharing systems to promote sustainable travel behavior in urban contexts with corresponding infrastructure planning. SMMS is associated with various social, environmental, and economic benefits, as well as providing solutions for the first- and the last-mile problem of using public transit. This study analyzes the usage patterns of e-scooter systems, based on the scooter operation data of VOI company in Gothenburg, Sweden. The used data cover the transaction data of two and half months during the summer and include over five hundred thousand valid trip records. The result shows that most trips travel a distance between 0.5–1.8 km while the duration lasts between 4–7 min. Fridays and Saturdays are the most popular days while Sunday is the least popular day. The number of trips on Sundays decreases by about 60% compared to Fridays and Saturdays. Moreover, the e-scooters are used to varying degrees in the different areas of Gothenburg. The e-scooters are used at a much higher extent in central Gothenburg compared to areas outside the city center. This can be due to several different factors such as location, land use, and accessibility. Lastly, the results show that the e-scooters are not primarily used for commuting but rather for leisure, which can be seen in the average distance and duration of the entire zone as well as the temporal distribution. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Contingency management in aviation is a vital concept that ensures safety, security, and efficiency in operations. To fully benefit from the envisioned Advanced Air Mobility system, the need of a structured and system-wide contingency planning will be even more important since the air transportation system paradigm will shift into a highly automated system that includes high-density traffic. The complexity will increase considerably by enlarging the operations to the underserved urban areas. Therefore, the new system needs to provide a more agile, accessible, and flexible environment. In this paper, the need of a contingency management from a holistic approach is described and the base requirements to build such a system are defined by considering the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder that are defined for the U-space system. Alongside the defined requirements, the tasks of the stakeholders and the expected main contingency sources are explained to have a better understanding of the system. The objective of this work is to provide the base guidelines that help to set appropriate actions by relevant stakeholder under an adverse condition which might compromise the safety and security of the operations within the air traffic network. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Promoting sustainable transportation, ride-sourcing and dynamic ridesharing (DRS) services have transformative impacts on mobility, congestion, and emissions. As emerging mobility options, the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services has rarely been simultaneously examined. This study contributes to filling this gap by jointly analyzing the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services and examining how it varies across neighborhood-level built environment, transit accessibility and crime, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors. To achieve these objectives, unique geo-coded data containing millions of ride-sourcing and DRS trips in Chicago are spatially joined with up-to-date data on the built environment, transit accessibility, crime, active travel, and demographic factors. A novel Markov Random Field-based joint heterogeneous geo-additive copula framework is presented to simultaneously capture random, systematic, and spatial heterogeneity. Characterized by a Frank copula structure, the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services exhibited a non-linear stochastic dependence pattern. With spatial heterogeneity and spillover effects, the stochastic dependence of ride-sourcing and DRS demand varied across time of day and was the strongest in compact and dense neighborhoods. Key aspects of the built environment related to urban design (pedestrian-oriented infrastructure), density, and land-use diversity were positively associated with ride-sourcing and DRS demand—suggesting that sustainable mobility goals can be achieved by continuing to invest in more walkable neighborhoods. Active travel and telecommuting were positively linked with ride-sourcing and DRS demand. Complementary and substitutive effects for transit accessibility were found. Results show that increasing transit accessibility in areas with low levels of accessibility (compared to those with high transit levels) could be more helpful in increasing the adoption of ride-sourcing and DRS services. Relative to ride-sourcing, the demand for DRS services appeared more responsive to improvements in pedestrian-infrastructure and transit accessibility. Quantification of non-linear associations with ceiling and overdose effects for the built environment, vehicle ownership, and transit accessibility provided deeper insights. The findings can help guide the development of policy interventions and investment decisions to further accelerate the adoption of mobility-on-demand systems. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Sustainable mobility adopts as principal criteria: rationalizing motorized transport use, upgrading to more energy-efficient means of transport, and ensuring the balanced distribution of the available space; Sustainability results in lower emissions of Green House Gas (GHG), pollutants, and noise. Sustainable mobility aims to reduce accidents and congestion and improve the accessibility levels associated with collective public transport (CPT). It would reconcile social cohesion, economic prosperity, and quality of life. It's would also ensure sustainability that would prevent the benefits of today from being damaged tomorrow. Thereby, the development of Moroccan cities, based on an increase in using private vehicles and on a widening or constructing road infrastructure, is not enough “sustainable”; The territorial and transport actual policy need a more sustainable vision. This article presents the research results to set up a sustainable mobility plan for Fez. It sets realistic objectives to correct the current trend. The sustainability indicators set makes it possible to quantify the improvement made and decide on the action's opportunity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Mobility must be intelligent, safe, fair, and adapted to the environment to be sustainable. It must improve the quality of citizen’s life by safeguarding human health and natural ecosystems. Sustainable mobility must optimize resource consumption and public spaces, facilitate accessibility, promote economic dynamism, respect environmental integrity and commit the social responsibility of individuals, companies, and society. Thus, sustainable mobility contributes to the development and responds to the travel demands of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This article presents research results to set up a sustainable mobility model for Fez, a Morrocan booming city. It offers a conceptual approach to simulate the trend in mobility and allows us to measure the positive impact of the corrections made. A supply analysis and the need for trips in a reference situation allows formalizing realistic objectives. Then, a sustainable mobility model prevents social and environmental costs from being higher than the services provided by the transport systems of this city. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The movement of human flows, vehicles, and goods leads to various interactions. Almost all interactions require us to travel. Therefore, the result is the movement of traffic flows. In general, transportation planning makes interaction as easy and efficient as possible. Transportation management is an integral part of city planning. The city plan will cause many traffic problems without considering the transportation patterns. Good urban transportation systems should make public transportation the primary means of mobility; however, people are still reluctant to use public transport in developing countries such as Indonesia. There are still many people who prefer to use private transportation. This study aims to analyze the effect of public transportation management on city planning in Medan. The samples of this research are all the users of public transportations at Medan who are 400 people. The collection methods are coming interviews, distribution of questionnaires, and documentary studies. The data analysis method used in this study is the multiple regression linear analysis. The research results showed that simultaneous transportation encompasses means of transportation, transport infrastructure, service quality, accessibility, public transport routes, and the integration of modes. These significantly affect city planning in Medan, with mode integration being a partially dominant factor of influence. The services of different ways of transport should be integrated with an easy and convenient mode transfer scope © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License},

abstract={For decades, the identification of human action has been one of the most critical study areas in artificial intelligence research. The study in human activity recognition aims to classify people's behavior based on data that is already accessible, such as pictures, visual, sensing, or stream recorded data, among other things. A common distinction made by most human activity recognition methods is between daily tasks such as walking and specific behaviors like standing or sitting. More specialized functions targeted to the use-case of pedestrian interior navigation are investigated in this study. These activities include several types of stationary and movement activities and various other activities. A deep learning-based human activity recognition framework is presented that can be used to recognize people's actions inside an indoor localization situation by analyzing smartphone inertial sensor data. Furthermore, we introduced a 1D-ResNet-SE model in the framework and assessed it using a publicly available dataset known as the Activity Logs dataset. According to the experimental measurements, the 1D-ResNet-SE surpasses other standard deep learning techniques in terms of accuracy, with a maximum accuracy of 84.11% in the general scenario. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In the post-healthcare context, protecting patients against pandemic diseases like COVID-19 has become designers' responsibility; the amount and effectiveness of change are unknown, particularly in terms of future design. This study explores the potential significance of waiting area typology within outpatient clinics in generating a healthy and therapeutic environment for patients and users in terms of social distancing, as well as whether there is a relationship between outpatient and the provision of social distancing. This study employed a quantitative approach based on space syntax theory, through four different syntactic maps (Isovist, Axial, Convex and Visibility Graph Analysis), to depict hospitals in Erbil city by adopting five outpatient layout typologies such as centralized and decentralized (linear, lobby, sectoral and mixed), through measuring wayfinding, accessibility, privacy, density and circulation as outpatient layout typology factors. Results identified that there is a clear effect of outpatient layout typology factors on providing social distancing especially in waiting areas, the decentralized outpatient layout represented by both sectoral and linear typologies is the most useful typology based on social distancing compared to others. Given the influential role of outpatient layout in providing a healthy and safe healing atmosphere with more social distancing for patients, research findings provide a useful resource for healthcare designers, particularly for waiting areas within outpatient clinics. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={The functional classification system (FCS) of roads means categorizing roads based on their service characteristics. The two primary considerations in classifying highway and street networks are accessibility and mobility, where by increasing the role of one, the other's role is reduced. In this paper, besides the conventional variables such as geometric design characteristics, parking lots, land use features, and accessibility; the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) data following the real-time traffic flow and average speed of vehicles collected by Location-Based Services (LBS) are considered as new variables for estimating the FCS. Linear regression is used to model the importance of the variables. The chi-square test compared the observational and predicted speeds in the five categories of roads in Tehran, the capital of Iran. Results show that on-street parking has the highest impact and the land use variable has the lowest impact on speed that changes the FCS. Moreover, the presented classification was one to two categories compared with the conventional FCS presented in manuals in the case of Tehran's transportation network as a developing city. © 2022 Mostafa Mehdian et al.},

abstract={The promotion of active aging and healthy mobility among seniors is a global challenge. The recent diffusion of e-bikes, mobility scooters, and electric tricycles has disclosed new opportunities for older adults to get around with less effort and much later in life than they previously imagined. As electric micro-mobility makes it easier for older people to stay active and reduce isolation, they might, in turn, require cities and communities to implement better, more people-centric infrastructure to support them, delivering great benefits for residents and commuters of all ages, as well. Within this framework, this chapter presents objectives and preliminary outcomes of an applied research on IoT-based urban services, commissioned by one of the leading Italian utility operatings in environmental field, and dealing with the design and installation of a network of Smart Hubs, accessible and versatile street furniture combining electric charging station with a wide range of other urban services. Smart Hubs’ network represents a cutting edge IoT application providing a smarter user experience for all city users, especially the elderly. The inclusive design approach combines physical and digital elements to improve well-being and offers innovative urban services. The chapter will point out how brand new IoT-based solutions and the global diffusion of electric micro-mobility have the potential to rewrite the consolidate distribution, density and features of services found in a traditional bike-friendly city, as they enable commuters and citizens, even those that can no longer cycle on a regular bike or comfortably moving around by foot, to reach longer distances in a shorter amount of time. Beyond the design of a new street furniture supporting personal electric vehicles, the research investigates the most effective aggregation of different public amenities and facilities (public restrooms, hydration stations, benches and others) and figures out the possible impacts of these smart living environments throughout the city on seniors’ mobility and autonomy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Micromobility and particularly e-scooter sharing services gained a rapid increase in popularity the last decade. Since cities encounter multiple challenges linked with transportation (i.e. traffic congestion, air pollution, limited green areas and decrease of social mobility and accessibility), micromobility gained attractiveness as a possible solution to these challenges. This paper provides insights for the development and operation of advanced micromobility solutions in order to meet traveler’s and local stakeholder’s expectations and safety and environmental requirements. Research findings come from two research activities that took place in the island of Rhodes, Greece, in terms of the national research project NEMO. NEMO aims at introducing an advanced e-scooter solution (considering both hardware and software add-ons) meeting current and future mobility needs.

abstract={This article presents the virtualization project of the Motilla del Azuer archaeological site in Daimiel (Ciudad Real, Spain). This project is using new and unique tools for the research, documentation, interpretation and dissemination carried out in this important prehistoric site. The incorporation of digital documentation and Virtual Reality (VR), advanced technological tools in the archaeological and cultural heritage fields, open new ways for managing cultural legacies. Modern advances in 3D digitization and VR allow the application of these techniques on a wide range of cultural assets with different characteristics and chronologies, opening a broad spectrum of new possibilities in research, education, and public outreach. This is an expanding area of heritage management which creates a positive impact on the economic, cultural and social activities of local communities and regions. Because of these positive impacts, more and more stakeholders such as institutions, administrations, and heritage organisations are taking an active interest in this sector of technological development. In the case of the Motilla del Azuer archaeological site, the digitization and virtualization work undertaken, along with other dissemination activities, have provided critical products for the presentation, interpretation, and promotion of this monument. La Motilla del Azuer is one of the most unique archaeological sites in Spain. Dating from the Bronze Age, it is a fortification with a central plan, formed by three lines of concentric walls distributed around a central tower (Fig. 2). Inside, the labyrinthine shape of the access systems is remarkable, made up of narrow corridors, stairs, ramps… This defensive enclosure allowed the protection and control of essential products for the people of the Bronze Age. Its true uniqueness is that it encloses a monumental water well which is over 15 m deep. La Motilla del Azuer is open to the public and receives thousands of visitors each year. But for conservation reasons, the number of people who can access the site is highly controlled. Likewise, due to its defensive nature and its age, it is a space where circulation is difficult, so it is impossible to visit for people with reduced mobility. For these and other reasons, the Daimiel City Council, in collaboration with the US non-profit entity Global Digital Heritage and the Spanish company Myou Software, has developed a project to digitize the archaeological site and make it accessible through an installed VR system, located permanently in the Daimiel Museum, the interpretation centre for the site (Fig. 10). This facility is designed to be used both by people in wheelchairs or with reduced mobility, as well as by all visitors to the museum; it provides a realistic virtual tour of the site. To achieve this level of realism, a detailed 3D digitization of the site using photogrammetry, laser scanning, and 3D spherical photography was undertaken, and a VR installation based on the use of an HTC Vive Pro device that has motion controllers for hands (HTC Vive controllers) and feet (HTC Vive Trackers) was created. The primary software is called Myou Engine, an open-source 3D engine compatible with XR, developed by the Myou Software company. In order to increase the immersiveness as much as possible, the Myou Software company has also designed a control system called Natural Locomotion that works by moving the arms and legs (Fig. 11). The final result of the project has allowed the implementation of an innovative VR space that increases accessibility to the archaeological site, represents a new tourist attraction for the town, and promotes new ways of managing and enjoying archaeological heritage. © UPV, SEAV, 2015},

abstract={To add a member in a distributed network, Vehicular Clouds (VCs) offer better scope for exploration. Incorporation of VCs aids in developing vehicular frameworks with acute reception. Reliability should be ensured in the VC for delivering additional processing capabilities and managing the statistics collected within the scope. In this paper, a secure evaluation framework that ensures protection of statistics, trustworthiness of data and accessibility of assets is proposed. It is essential to offer reliability of the framework that is based on VCs. A three-level secure structure that is sustainable and appropriate for vehicular organizations to detect reckless vehicles is designed. Cooperative Driving Performance Rating (CDPR) element is used to certainly apprehend rashly driven cars based on Machine Learning (ML) based computations. To generate alarms, a three-layered framework is formed for existing vehicular organizations which incorporate vehicles, Road Side Units (RSUs) and cloud users. The scheme provides paths to the vehicles by involving reduced transmission overhead of the CDPR element. The vehicles transfer the statistics of the user movements to the RSUs. Based on the gathered statistics, the vehicles are charged. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) are used to carry out the process. The proposed CDPR element can be incorporated into a vehicular organization and a simulated framework is designed using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to assess the performance. The proposed system offers a secured alarming framework to remove rashly driven cars and rightly deliver cautions to the organizations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Urban systems studies in the last decades have greatly benefited from the digital revolution and the accumulation of a massive amount of data. Extracting useful information from these data calls for new and innovative theoretical and computational approaches. This work presents an open-source, modular, and scalable platform for urban planning and transports network analysis, the CityChrone [citychrone.org]. The platform shows, on interactive maps, measures of performances of public transport in cities. The measures are based on the computation of the travel time distance between a large set of points. Thanks to the high efficiency of the routing algorithm developed, the platform allows users to create new public transports networks and showing the effect on mobility in a small amount of time. A preliminary analysis of the user-generated scenarios is presented. All the source code of the CityChrone platform is open-source, and we employ only open data to ensure the reproducibility of results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={One of the major challenges for blind and visually impaired (BVI) people is traveling safely to cross intersections on foot. Many countries are now generating audible signals at crossings for visually impaired people to help with this problem. However, these accessible pedestrian signals can result in confusion for visually impaired people as they do not know which signal must be interpreted for traveling multiple crosses in complex road architecture. To solve this problem, we propose an assistive system called CAS (Crossing Assistance System) which extends the principle of the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) signal for outdoor and indoor location tracking and overcomes the intrinsic limitation of outdoor noise to enable us to locate the user effectively. We installed the system on a real-world intersection and collected a set of data for demonstrating the feasibility of outdoor RSSI tracking in a series of two studies. In the first study, our goal was to show the feasibility of using outdoor RSSI on the localization of four zones. We used a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method and showed it led to 99.8% accuracy. In the second study, we extended our work to a more complex setup with nine zones, evaluated both the kNN and an additional method, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with various RSSI features for classification. We found that the SVM performed best using the RSSI average, standard deviation, median, interquartile range (IQR) of the RSSI over a 5 s window. The best method can localize people with 97.7% accuracy. We conclude this paper by discussing how our system can impact navigation for BVI users in outdoor and indoor setups and what are the implications of these findings on the design of both wearable and traffic assistive technology for blind pedestrian navigation. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={In an era of complexity, rapid technological advance and need for climate change action, urban roads may need to transform. The aim of this research is to identify the concepts underpinning the fundamental dimensions of the future urban road and open up an interdisciplinary dialogue about its delivery. We used a combinatorial approach incorporating a Systematic Literature Review to a Q-method. The Systematic Literature Review identifies 28 transforming concepts and organises them into five categories, namely: efficiency, safety, liveability, accessibility, and smart technology. Through a Q-method study, 50 transport experts “described” the urban road of the future. Four main factors emerged classifying the experts into: People-First Techno-Centrists (smart technology used as an enabler of human-centric transport futures), Autonomous Vehicles Sceptics, (AVs should not be the key paradigm-changer) Unconventionalists (shared road space and mixed uses should prevail) and Infrastructurists (safety-first multimodal infrastructure interventions should lead any change). The main dilemmas that arise are: a) prioritisation of modes: human first or not? b) share or segregate? and c) design systems or roads? © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Rapid motorisation with high motorcycle volume is a unique traffic situation in Asian developing countries. The travel behaviour in these countries is dominated by motorcycle-traffic-culture in which the convenience of this transport mode is exploited. With the ability to enter small alleys and to serve door-to-door mobility, motorcycles are excellent in accessibility and reducing travel time. As a result, the willingness to shift to bus and urban railway of transport users are limited. In a long term, local government might get difficulties in developing public transport to achieve sustainable transport system. This study aims to examine the travel mode choice of university students in a developing country where motorcycles have been dominating traffic systems. With the data collected from 396 students in five universities in Hanoi, Vietnam, a conditional logit regression model was developed to explore individual and alternative specific variables influencing the mode choice for studying trips. Key finding shows that travel time has significant impact on travel mode choice. Research results are beneficial for transport planners and transport authorities to develop appropriate transport planning and management strategies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for urban sustainability, which can promote the low carbon transition of urban mobility systems and increase energy independence. However, inadequate access to charging infrastructure has posed significant challenges on penetration to the mass market, which requires an equitable distribution of public charging facilities among residents. Current planning and deployment of public charging facilities only take efficiency into account, with limited attention to the spatial equity in distribution. Hence, this study proposes a spatial statistical approach to evaluate whether electric vehicle charging services (EVCS) are equitably distributed. An innovative accessibility measurement model is first developed for EVCS, considering competition over changing demand and different charging capacities. On this basis, a spatial autocorrelation analysis procedure is further designed to investigate spatial patterns of residential accessibility and detect regional disparities. The proposed methodology is tested with the top ten cities in China by their capacity of EVCS, where most cities exhibit significant inequitable distribution but with different regional characteristics. It is demonstrated that the methodology can improve the accuracy of measurement while remaining easy to implement. Therefore, it can serve as a policy tool for EVCS planning to maximize its capability to facilitate EV uptake. © 2021},

abstract={Current policies on urban regeneration and population ageing call for new assessment models that address the obsolescence of social housing in the built environment, thereby promoting efficient and sustainable renovation strategies. The elderly represent more than 20% of the total population in European countries, for whom mobility and accessibility limitations remain key aspects to be solved. This research establishes an accessibility assessment model for social housing, conceived as a decision support system that contributes towards the diagnosis of the main risks and the selection of optimal actions for the adaptation of multi-family buildings. This system also provides a specific technical inspection tool to verify the fulfilment of accessibility regulations. The novelty of the proposed model involves weighting mechanisms for the quantification of action suitability through 3 main indices: Appropriateness, Priority, and Feasibility. These indices are quantitatively and qualitatively valued from technical and socio-economic perspectives. The operation is applied and tested in representative multi-family buildings from southern Europe, which attains 90% of non-compliances and risks, and displays an innovative decision-making outline for owners, promoters, and policy-makers. The conclusions drawn include key outcomes for technicians and users, by providing mechanisms that promote efficient renovation proposals regarding accessibility in social housing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Bike-Sharing Systems (BSSs) support urban mobility by strengthening the scope of public transport networks, which may be insufficient in smart cities. This paper aims to present a hybrid approach that includes a Fuzzy Logic (FL)-based Geographic Information System (GIS), the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the VIse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, and the Psychometric-VIKOR method for the problem of the selection of BSS station sites depending on transportation and recreational land uses. The FL approach was included in the GIS analysis in order to characterize the uncertainty of a potential passenger's tendency to start a trip at a station within an accessible distance from the urban facilities. By combining fuzzy-based GIS analysis with the AHP method, a spatial analysis was performed for the deployment of BSS stations. The VIKOR and Psychometric-VIKOR methods were used to evaluate the performance of current and alternative locations of BSS station. This study is the first known application of the Psychometric-VIKOR method for the problem of the selection of BSS locations. The innovative hybrid approach can be used by authorities as a useful tool in solving decision-making problems that involve uncertainty in future urban investments. © 2021},

abstract={The problem of creating an inclusive environment in urban agrorecreational eco-complexes are considered. The peculiarities of the criteria of accessibility, informativeness and comfort have been determined in the article. There were analyzed and classified requirements for the design of urban agrorecreational eco-complexes taking into account the needs of people with limited mobility. The main means of inclusive environment in urban agrorecreational eco-complexes have also been determined. There have been analyzed the following main means of barrier-free accessibility for the elements of the external space of urban agrorecreational eco-complexes: external ramp, exit ramp, raised pedestrian crossing, lifting device, external stairs, parking space for a person with disabilities. The authors have considered the main elements of universal (inclusive) design and barrier-free environment in interior space of urban agrorecreational eco-complexes: internal ramp, internal stairs, approach ramp, elevator, internal lifting device, escalator, ambulatory compartment for people with disabilities. The main means of universal (inclusive) design for the elements of external and internal space of urban agrorecreational eco-complexes have been outlined in this scientific survey. The following tactile elements of accessibility have been considered: tactile guiding strip, warning tactile strip, informational tactile strip, tactile resource book. Visual accessibility elements (signs in contrast colors, information plates and informers) and auditory accessibility elements (external detectors or speech systems), have also been identified and analyzed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Development in the field of technology and its penetration to the extent that ease the life of common man in any economy in general and urban areas in particular are very much needed in today’s world. Technological development and its uses in domain like agriculture, industry, banking and finance, transportation, infrastructure, and many more play an important role in any economic system. Intelligent infrastructure and transportation is need of hour. In Indian content particularly, there are certain urban center where due to inadequate intelligent infrastructure and transportation facilities, it is not only creating problems for its population in terms of easy accessibility or mobility but at the same time hampering the growth of city too along with generations of many other problems. Thus, having learnt that technological development plays an important role, an attempt is being made in this paper to look at intelligent infrastructure and transportation system to solve various problems associated with public transportation system in Jaipur city of Rajasthan, since the city is facing severe problems associated with passenger movement along with available transport facilities. Also, an attempt is being made to understand how best the system be developed so it can help the city to grow further. Hence, for this bus transport with reference to passenger movement in Jaipur is taken into consideration as a case for the purpose of the study. Also, this paper is proposing real-life situation which would be analytical and technological based in relation with intelligent transportation and intelligent infrastructure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Loss of vision caused by infectious diseases has decreased significantly; however aging will increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment. Visual information is the basis of most navigation tasks; a person is considered visually impaired when he has no appropriate information on the surrounding environment. With the latest evolution of digital technologies, the assistance provided to visually disabled people during their mobility can be improved. In this context, we propose a system to help the visually impaired move quickly and to know their environment. Indoors, the system uses a stereoscopic camera, a portable computer, and a headset to direct and help visually impaired persons navigate comfortably and securely in familiar and unfamiliar environments. Outdoors, a GPS is used as a positioning method to keep the visually impaired person on the right path; with its dynamic routing and rerouting capabilities, it provides the user with an optimized path. The system can work on an outdoor and indoor environment. A stereoscopic camera is used to detect visual indicators that are used to trace and validate user navigation, provide accurate indoor location measurements, and recognize objects in front of the user. This article is mainly focused on this system and detailed outlines description. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The improvement of pedestrian mobility through the use of on-street vertical facilities, i.e. escalators, moving sidewalks, lifts, funiculars and gondola lifts, is becoming increasingly important in many cities with steep slopes that hinder walkers’ transit. However, studies on the acceptance, profitability and demand for these facilities are still scarce. The present paper proposes an assessment methodology to evaluate the demand for vertical pedestrian routes and facilities based on diverse accessibility indicators. This methodology was applied to the city of Santander (Spain), where flow measurements and surveys among users of existing vertical walking systems were carried out. These data were modeled using Poisson and Binomial Negative regressions, considering the truncated and discrete character of the dependent variable. The results obtained confirm that vertical walking facilities are highly valued by users. Contrary to expectations, accessibility from these facilities to public services or commercial areas was not relevant to estimate the demand of the existing routes and only accessibility to population proved to be significant. Therefore, it is advisable to install this type of walking facilities in those pedestrian routes located in areas with enough population density over well-equipped central areas, so that the number of potential users justifies their investment and maintenance costs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The development of navigation tools for people who are visually impaired had become an important concern in the research area of assistive technologies. This paper gives a comprehensive review of different articles published in the area of navigation solutions for people who are visually impaired. Unlike other review papers, this review considers major solutions that work in both the indoor or/and outdoor environments which are based on different technology. From the review, it became clear that the navigation systems proposed for the target users lack some core features that are quite important for independent navigation. Also, there can be instances in which humanitarian conditions also have to be considered in the navigation system design. Based on these findings, a set of recommendations are also given which can be considered in the future design of navigation systems for blind and visually impaired people. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Purpose: Manual wheelchair users are more vulnerable, in situations such as road crossings, hazardous sidewalks or curbs and crossing of buildings and facilities threshold. Geospatial assistive technology (GAT) can help with route planning. However, it is important to ensure the usability of such products, as well as the satisfaction of persons with reduced mobility. The study’s aim was (1) to develop and validate a questionnaire on the satisfaction of GAT, in English and French, and to (2) assess satisfaction, efficacy and efficiency of a GAT with manual wheelchair users following a filmed trial in a dense urban area. Method: A methodological study was conducted (development of the questionnaire, assessment of its content validity, feasibility and practicability) followed by a trial and post-observations with the videos. Two questionnaires (English, French) were concurrently validated by two groups of experts (n = 8), and then field-tested by wheelchair users (n = 8), using Google Maps Pedestrian routeing tool. Results: The Evaluation of satisfaction with geospatial assistive technology (ESGAT) consists in a user profile and their experience with the technology, followed by 12 satisfaction criteria rated from 1-not satisfied to 5-very satisfied. Both questionnaires were rated as feasible and practicable to complete. The usability of Google Maps Pedestrian routeing tool was measured as “moderate” by manual wheelchairs since the total satisfaction score at the ESGAT was 3.9/5 (quite satisfied). The items with the lowest score were navigation assistance, hands-free function and security. The GAT was effective (87.5% have completed their destination) but not efficient (37.5% needed help).IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION For manual wheelchair users paired with geospatial assistive technology: • A 10 minutes questionnaire was developed and validated to assess their satisfaction after testing aid in an urban area. • Satisfaction criteria to address are ease of access (service), learnability, hands-free function, ease of use for planning as well for navigating, transportability/ appearance, content, geographic information, effectiveness, efficiency, navigation assistance and security • A field test is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the technology in avoiding or announcing potential obstacles such as sidewalk crossing ramp, damaged and congested sidewalk; sidewalk tilt (side slopes); thresholds at destination; verbal indication too soon or too late; incorrect indication; the arrow does not indicate the right direction; readjustment of the route needed; a lack of indication; and human intervention needed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The enthusiasm with which several metropolises have promoted and embraced the idea of the '15-minute city' may now provide a useful opportunity to reflect once again on the well-known relationship between urban planning and mobility planning. Urban policies and plans are recently rediscovering a new focus on the proximity dimension and active mobility, progressively excluding the obsolete car-centric model. In this perspective, the paper aims at assessing 15-minute neighbourhoods through a GIS-based model to evaluate pedestrian accessibility to urban services and spaces. The implemented methodology integrates the assessment of walking distances and the mapping of the resident population distribution. The method is then applied to measure the current performance of an existing neighbourhood in Parma, assessing accessibility based on home-facility travel times and the resident population within reach. A reflection is proposed on what has been learned and on the possible contribution that the method can bring to urban monitoring and planning. © 2021 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

abstract={Sustainable development is one of the great challenges for the future of cities. The public authorities have the role of accompanying cities towards sustainable development and should promote territorial policies that guarantee both economic growth and environmental protection. In this way, they assume a central role in the glo-cal process from global goals and local development. Calabria, as regional public authority, through the Regional Transport Plan, has defined the transport and logistics policy including urban areas and indicating interventions to go towards sustainability. These include city logistics, limited traffic zone and other measures. The interventions aim to contain polluting emissions and transport costs, to promote safe mobility and to improve accessibility. The experimental process has involved citizens, researchers and local authorities in an integrated approach also aimed at linking different roles. The example of Calabria provides information to technicians and policy-makers of general application in all other European regions. © 2021 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

abstract={Autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize new technology that promises to enhance transportation equity, accessibility, and safety; however, their acceptance by consumers, as well as their future performance, is reliant upon the planners understanding the public's perceptions of the current transportation services. Most of the existing studies that evaluate the public's opinions and perceptions of AV technology were conducted by using stated preference surveys in metropolitan areas with multiple public transit options; little emphasis was given to a qualitative approach that included all of the potential users. This study explores the concerns and preferences of future riders about the integration of a shared self-driving shuttle into an existing ridesharing service in a city with no existing public transit system, multiple population segments, and potential users. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we conducted three focus groups that were comprised of the general public; university faculty, staff, and students; and people with disabilities in Arlington, Texas (n = 24). A content analysis method was implemented to analyze the data and identify the main themes and subthemes related to each discussion. The results revealed that all three groups identified service accessibility, flexibility, and reliability as the factors that most strongly shape the demand for existing transportation services. Additionally, people with disabilities cited the capacity of the existing paratransit service and the lack of access to distant health care facilities as barriers that frequently prevent them from using the service. Participants also expressed their concerns about the proposed shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) service, and while accessibility and safety were the primary concerns, they also worried about the capacity of the service, the trip cost, and provisions for people with disabilities. Participants with disabilities indicated that they would adopt the SAV as long as service planners provide a supportive environment such as access to sidewalks, ramps, and curb cuts in the pick-up and drop-off locations. This study provides insights into transportation strategies that can integrate SAVs into existing on-demand ridesharing services to improve people's mobility needs. To predict the short-term and long-term adoption of an SAV deployment, it is essential to identify the potential users' concerns, preferences, and expectations of self-driving technology. The research findings are expected to support transportation planners and policymakers in their quest to recognize and utilize the most effective ways to promote the efficiency of SAV services. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={One of the main challenges facing the city is the need to improve the conditions of urban mobility and accessibility as fundamental aspects of urban life with social, spatial, functional, and cultural repercussions for adaptation to climate change. For this purpose, analysing thermal comfort and the influence of microclimate as the main factors of determining urban heat islands (UHI) caused by solar radiation from construction materials and surfaces leads to the following research question: How do pedestrian zones affect the microclimate and how can they contribute to thermal comfort? The objective of this article is to evaluate the environmental performance of the urban microclimate in a single street in the historic centre of the city of Tarija. The method consists of applying a simulation with the ENVI-met 4.4.5 software to two scenarios: 1) asphalt road and parking areas, and 2) pedestrian path with vegetation and natural surface materials. The simulated maps present variables of air temperature, T surface, and radiant temperature to determine the level of thermal comfort calculated with the predicted mean vote index (V). The results showed a 6°C difference in the surface temperature between both scenarios, and the PMV index was comfortable at 9:00, while later, at 12h and 15h, the index improved with the incorporation of vegetation and natural materials on the road surface. Similarly, through remote sensing, 5.14°C was obtained as the land surface temperature (LST). These indicators spotlight the effects of the change in the urban microclimate to improved decision-making in urban design and argue for a network of pedestrian areas in the city. © 2021 Urbani Izziv.

According to the internet and mobile association of India (IAMAI) 2016, 69 % of internet users belong from age groups 19–35 in urban India, which establishes the need to study internet use on travel behaviour of the different socio-demographic groups. The focus is on establishing the relation between virtual accessibility, out-of-home activities, and individual mobility. The data collected for this study include the extent of ICT usage, socio-demographic variables and details of participation in activities. The analysis demonstrates the causal link; we were using the structural equation model (SEM) for analysis. Finding revealed a stronger relationship between virtual accessibility and leisure activities. High-income group households are more likely associated with great use of online activities. The younger age population uses a high degree of virtual application. The finding further revealed a negative relationship between ICT and travel. This research also highlights the mediation effect of time use for different activities between virtual accessibility and travel. This study can aid transport planners/engineers/policymakers in travel demand analysis while considering the factor (virtual accessibility) of the new technological environment. © 2021},

abstract={Road traffic congestion can inevitably degrade road infrastructure and decrease travel efficiency in urban traffic networks, which can be relieved by employing appropriate congestion control. According to different developmental driving forces, in this paper, the evolution of road traffic congestion control is divided into two stages. The ever-growing number of advanced sensing techniques can be seen as the key driving force of the first stage, called the sensing stage, in which congestion control strategies experienced rapid growth owing to the accessibility of traffic data. At the second stage, i.e., the communication stage, communication and computation capability can be regarded as the identifying symbols for this stage, where the ability of collecting finer-grained insight into transportation and mobility reality improves dramatically with advances in vehicular networks, Big Data, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, as the pre-requisite for congestion control, in this paper, existing congestion detection techniques are first elaborated and classified. Then, a comprehensive survey of the recent advances for current congestion control strategies with a focus on traffic signal control, vehicle route guidance, and their combined techniques is provided. In this regard, the evolution of these strategies with continuous development of sensing, communication, and computation capability are also introduced. Finally, the paper concludes with several research challenges and trends to fully promote the integration of advanced techniques for traffic congestion mitigation in transportation systems. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.},

abstract={With the spread of an aging society, the mobility constrained seniors' need for public transportation is increasing. This paper investigates accessibility to welfare facilities for elderly people, that is, whether elderly people can easily access the welfare facilities that they frequently visit. We consider welfare facilities including residential welfare institutions, medical and welfare institutions, leisure and welfare institutions, and commuting-system welfare facilities. We verify spatial distribution of welfare facilities and relationship to the unequal development of urban or public transportation networks. Inequality of accessibility was found between the urban and suburban areas of the study area. This paper identified the spatial inequity of facilities for elderly people by measuring spatial accessibility considering public transportation accessibility and walking time to the facilities. This paper suggested that improving public transportation accessibility would increase the spatial equity of welfare services for elderly people. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={This paper examines urban patterns of car sharing supply and demand at neighbourhood level. By using literature on spatial inequality and unequal mobility access, we provide new insights into the urban geographies of car sharing. We draw on register data of members and vehicles of station-based car sharing for Oslo, Norway, spatially coupled with population composition, urban form and public transport accessibility ratios. We find both the demand and supply of station-based car sharing to be unevenly distributed. Some of the most profound contributors to car sharing demand include middle income levels, middle and higher levels of education, higher shares of the population working in cultural sectors, higher shares of men, higher shares of multifamily housing, and higher strengths of the public transport regime compared to that of the private car. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for sustainable urban mobility, mobility justice and urban and transport planning. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Socio-demographic trends and recent economic development patterns have resulted in travel behavior changes that call for more flexible and accessible public transit options. Because flexible transit services vary in scope, size, and service type, new data-informed methods are useful to optimize services based on the specific needs of local communities and riders. In this study, real-world demand and vehicle trajectory data were used to evaluate and optimize system performance for an existing first-mile–last-mile (FMLM) service in Robinson Township, PA. A general FMLM model for arbitrary demand and service supply was then developed to quantify system performance—both travel time costs and day-to-day reliability—for various operational polices considering spatio-temporal demand variation and transportation network dynamics. Heuristics were used for optimal real-time vehicle routing in sizable real-world networks accommodating various service types and scopes. In this case study, total user costs were reduced by 18.6% when rides were coordinated with mainline fixed-route transit. Predictive routing strategies were shown to marginally improve system performance under sparse and variable spatio-temporal demand. The case study also highlights potentially large travel time and user reliability improvements—reductions of 51% and 53.8%, respectively—when trip requests were made in advance of their desired pickup time. Finally, we show that travel time reliability can be improved for time-inflexible trips with trip prioritization without increasing total user costs. These results were stable to changes in demand density. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Travel surveys show that the amount of private car driving in Norway has increased significantly since the mid-1980s. Private car driving has for a long time been the main mode of transport for retail and service trips, and grocery shopping trips represent over 60% of the retail and service travels. Despite the growing number of studies addressing accessibility to daily destinations, to the best of the authors’ knowledge there are no studies examining these issues over time. Methods: This paper aims to investigate changes in accessibility to grocery stores over time and use two counties in Norway as examples. Based on GIS data at a detailed level, distances from dwellings to nearest grocery store has been examined. Findings: The results from the spatial analyses reveal significant changes from 1980 to 2019: The share of the population living within 500-m from a grocery store has decreased from 55% to 34% in one of the counties examined and from 36% to 19% in the other. This indicates that the share of people living within walking distance to a local grocery store has nearly halved. With such changes in accessibility to grocery stores, increased car driving for grocery shopping should not come as a surprise. Contrary to the frequent statements about sustainable urban development and active transportation, it seems that Norway still is developing as a country that in the future will be more and not less dependent on private cars. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: This paper deals with the location of emergency medical stations where ambulances waiting to be dispatched are parked. The literature reports a lot of mathematical programming models used to optimize station locations. Most studies evaluate the models only analytically applying the same simplifying assumptions that were used in the modelling phase. In addition, they concentrate on systems operating one type of emergency units in homogeneous urban areas. The goal of our study is to identify which optimization criterion the emergency medical service (EMS) outcomes benefit from the most and which model should be used to design tiered systems in large urban–rural areas. Methods: A bi-criteria mathematical programming model is proposed. The criteria include the accessibility of high-priority patients within a short time limit and average response time to all patients. This model is being compared to the p-median model with a single response time objective and to a hierarchical pq-median model that considers two different vehicle types. A detailed computer simulation model is used to evaluate the solutions. The methodology is verified in the conditions of the Slovak Republic using real historical data on 149,474 ambulance trips performed in 2015. Results: All mathematical models improve EMS performance by relocating some stations compared to the current distribution. The best results are achieved by the hierarchical median-type model. The average response time is reduced by 58 s, the number of calls responded to within 15 min is increased by 5% and the number of high-priority calls responded to within 8 min by 6%. Conclusions: The EMS systems operating in heterogeneous areas should be designed to minimize response times, and not to maximize the number of calls served within a given time limit. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={On-demand transportation systems (OTS) are increasingly popular worldwide. Prior literature has studied how to control vehicle fleet in queueing-networks to rebalance excess supply or demand in OTS. This aggregated setting models the stochastic demand process and decompose large-scale networks for which product-form equilibrium distributions exist. However, such an approach is unsatisfactory in terms of computational complexity for its dependence on vehicle numbers. This paper presents a stochastic conic programming approach that obtains the near-optimal vehicle repositioning controls with endogenous demand with mild computational complexity and high fidelity. This global framework covers most existing queueing-network-based OTS models in the literature. Leveraging this approach, we explore day-to-day vehicle repositioning problems for on-demand vehicle operations in New York City. These results support the potential for providing a more accessible and sustainable on-demand mobility service, which is of particular significance as multimodal transport continues to emerge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a multi-objective coverage flight path planning algorithm that finds minimum length, collision-free, and flyable paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in three-dimensional (3D) urban environments inhabiting multiple obstacles for covering spatially distributed regions. In many practical applications, UAVs are often required to fully cover multiple spatially distributed regions located in the 3D urban environments while avoiding obstacles. This problem is relatively complex since it requires the optimization of both inter (e.g., traveling from one region/city to another) and intra-regional (e.g., within a region/city) paths. To solve this complex problem, we find the traversal order of each area of interest (AOI) in the form of a coarse tour (i.e., graph) with the help of an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm by formulating it as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) from the center of each AOI, which is subsequently optimized. The intra-regional path finding problem is solved with the integration of fitting sensors’ footprints sweeps (SFS) and sparse waypoint graphs (SWG) in the AOI. To find a path that covers all accessible points of an AOI, we fit fewer, longest, and smooth SFSs in such a way that most parts of an AOI can be covered with fewer sweeps. Furthermore, the low-cost traversal order of each SFS is computed, and SWG is constructed by connecting the SFSs while respecting the global and local constraints. It finds a global solution (i.e., inter + intra-regional path) without sacrificing the guarantees on computing time, number of turning maneuvers, perfect coverage, path overlapping, and path length. The results obtained from various representative scenarios show that proposed algorithm is able to compute low-cost coverage paths for UAV navigation in urban environments. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Increasing the market share of low-emission vehicles in relation to individual mobility is one of the main postulates of modern transport policy. In the discussion on low-emission and the new structure of the car fleet, the role of new vehicles is emphasized above all, ignoring the importance of the secondary market. In recent years, both in Poland and in other European Union countries, there has been a noticeable dynamic development of electromobility implementation processes in urban areas, the initial effect of which is increasing market accessibility to commercial vehicles with electric EV/BEV, hybrid HEV/PHEV and fuel cell powered FCEV. As in the case of vehicles powered by conventional ICEV fuels, also in relation to those defined as low-emission, their residual value is lost along with the operational process. Information on this variable is important both for the owner of a newly purchased vehicle, which after the period of its operation will decide to sell it as well as to the future buyer. The scientific aim of the study is to analyze the residual values of selected vehicle models from the primary and secondary market, with particular emphasis on stochastic operational phenomena. The subject of the research is to obtain extensive knowledge on the achieved changes in the residual values of low-emission vehicles in relation to ICEVs. For this purpose, a comparative analysis of the commercial program, data approximated from auction portals and own numerical modeling tool based on a neural network was performed. The research sample included, among others, selected models of passenger cars, the purchase offer of which included the choice of a drive unit powered by conventional and low-emission fuels. The use of this method allowed to answer the question whether low-emission vehicles are characterized by a greater or lesser loss of value in relation to conventionally powered vehicles ICEV. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Walking accessibility planning is seen a powerful approach for moving towards sustainable mobility paradigms; however little attention is paid to determining which factors influence this accessibility and why. This paper addresses this gap between the theory and the practice, and evaluates how far variations in walking accessibility are related to four specific walking needs: attractiveness, comfort, safety, and ease-to-walk. Taking the ‘Centro’ district in Madrid (Spain) as a case study, exploratory scenarios are simulated by altering certain urban design factors for each walking need. Walking accessibility levels are calculated and compared across the exploratory scenarios to gain an insight into how each urban design factor affects walking accessibility. The results show a similar spatial pattern of accessibility for the four walking needs, with higher accessibility values in the north than in the south due to the greater density of destinations. Urban factors related to attractiveness and comfort are found to produce the most significant variations in walking accessibility. The paper concludes with a discussion on the practical usefulness of the findings, particularly in terms of prioritising urban design policies that increase walking accessibility levels. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={New mobility services that facilitate multimodal options are important for strategic urban transport systems planning. Part of this strategy is municipal investment in urban mobility hubs to increase access to mobility services. We present a new evaluation framework and algorthim to locate and assess the sustainability and equity impacts of hubs in cities. Scenarios are used to evaluate hub investment strategies in different cities that prioritize (1) current mode split, (2) high transit capacity, and (3) multimodal services. From an equity perspective, high transit capacity and multimodal hub strategies include more low-income areas than current mode split, which covers middle-income areas most. Travel times to access the nearest hub in Portland by low-income households is ∼20–40 min compared to high-income households requiring ∼25–30 min. Seattle and Vancouver perform better requiring ∼15–20 min for low-income compared to ∼25–35 min for high-income households. Multimodal hubs are the most efficient requiring ∼15–20 minutes to reach compared to ∼15–30 minutes for high capacity and current mode split scenarios. From a sustainability perspective, ∼10%–50% of the population cannot reach a hub within 30 minutes by public transit compared to <10% by car, and travel time to reach the nearest hub in all three cities by car is <20 min compared to ∼20–40 min by public transit. Between all cities, low-income households representing ∼2%–15% of the total population have no access to a hub by public transit within 30 min compared to high-income households representing ∼1%–3% of the total population. Only in Portland are there low-income households not able to reach a hub by car, and in each city, all high-income households can reach at least one hub by car within 30 min. Our results show how municipalities can strategically invest in public transit and multimodal options to increase the frequency, quality, and overall mobility for low- and medium-income households and improve access to essential amenities for more vulnerable citizens. Municipalities can use our hub evaluation framework to explore alternative transport investment scenarios and spatially locate urban hubs to meet future travel demand, increase adoption of multimodal services, and improve equitable access for all citizens. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Sidewalks are central to an accessible transportation network, as they connect all other transportation modes. The street-side environment, especially the location and connectivity of the sidewalks, has not been widely integrated into information systems used to report accessibility and walkability in wayfinding applications. Typical sidewalk mapping methods rely on surveyor collections, which are non-standardized, laborious, costly, difficult to maintain, and do not scale well. In this work, we introduce a working proof-of-concept system for automated mapping of sidewalk networks on portable computing devices. Our system utilizes efficient neural networks, image sensing, GPS, and compact hardware to perform sidewalk mapping on portable devices. We discuss future opportunities for cities and transportation agencies to advance their knowledge of the transportation network they own and manage in order to improve accessibility for all travelers. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={While data on human behavior in COVID-19 rich environments have been captured and publicly released, spatial components of such data are recorded in two-dimensions. Thus, the complete roles of the built and natural environment cannot be readily ascertained. This paper introduces a mechanism for the three-dimensional (3D) visualization of egress behaviors of individuals leaving a COVID-19 exposed healthcare facility in Spring 2020 in New York City. Behavioral data were extracted and projected onto a 3D aerial laser scanning point cloud of the surrounding area rendered with Potree, a readily available open-source Web Graphics Library (WebGL) point cloud viewer. The outcomes were 3D heatmap visualizations of the built environment that indicated the event locations of individuals exhibiting specific characteristics (e.g., men vs. women; public transit users vs. private vehicle users). These visualizations enabled interactive navigation through the space accessible through any modern web browser supporting WebGL. Visualizing egress behavior in this manner may highlight patterns indicative of correlations between the environment, human behavior, and transmissible diseases. Findings using such tools have the potential to identify high-exposure areas and surfaces such as doors, railings, and other physical features. Providing flexible visualization capabilities with 3D spatial context can enable analysts to quickly advise and communicate vital information across a broad range of use cases. This paper presents such an application to extract the public health information necessary to form localized responses to reduce COVID-19 infection and transmission rates in urban areas. © 2021 C.

abstract={Today, social networks play a huge role in the life of a modern person Moreover, people can not only communicate in this way, but also share tips, professional skills, promote their services, buy goods, and so on. Every day, a huge amount of information appears in social networks. People ask questions about their future trips, share their travel experiences, talk about local attractions, post photos, praise or scold restaurants, museums and any other objects of the urban environment. In this paper, we consider a method for assessing the availability of urban improvement facilities for low-mobility groups of the population based on data from their social networks The study was conducted on the example of the Petrogradsky district of St. Petersburg. 25 objects of urban improvement (parks, gardens, squares) were selected, and reviews from Google Maps were uploaded for each object. A dictionary describing the accessibility of objects was prepared and a database search was conducted to find problems related to accessibility for low-mobility groups of the population that users write about. All reviews were depersonalized and depersonalized. Such data can be used by the city authorities when planning new facilities, or when implementing targeted programs for the development of improvement facilities. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Public transit is considered a sustainable mode of transport that can address automobile dependency and provide environmental, economic, and societal benefits. However, with typical temporal and spatial constraints such as fixed routes and schedules, transfer requirements, waiting times, and access/egress issues, public transit offers lower accessibility and mobility services than private vehicles and thus it is considered a less attractive mode to many prospective users. To improve the performance of transit and in turn to increase its usage, a broader understanding of the daily activity-travel patterns of transit users is fundamental. In this context, this study analyzed transit-based activity-travel patterns by classifying users via Latent Class Analysis (LCA). Using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, the LCA model suggested that transit users could be split into five distinct classes where each class has a representative activity-travel pattern. Class 1 constituted employed white males who made transit-dominant simple work tours. Class 2 was composed of employed white females who made complex work tours. Employed white millennials comprised Class 3 and made multimodal complex tours. Transit Class 4 were non-white younger or older adult groups who made transit-dominant simple non-work tours. Last, Class 5 members made complex non-work tours with recurrent transit use and comprised single older women. This study provided insights regarding the variations of activity-travel patterns and the associated market segments of transit users in the United States. The results can assist transit agencies in identifying transit user groups with particular activity patterns and to consider market strategies that can address their travel needs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Personal mobility is one of the fundamental human rights and it is vital to ensuring a productive and dignified life. It is estimated that there are more than 130 million people worldwide with a physical disability that requires the use of a wheelchair. In this context, public transport plays an important role, as a key element in guaranteeing equity in mobility and access to basic needs such as education, healthcare, employment and leisure. Urban rail systems represent an important medium and high-capacity mode of transport, largely used in daily journeys, especially within larger cities. Given the background, the aim of this article is to investigate wheelchair accessibility in urban rail systems around the world. In order to present this global overview, the official websites of the 212 urban rail systems in operation in 59 countries worldwide were consulted. The systems were classified into 7 different levels of accessibility, according to their percentage of declared adapted stations. The systems were then grouped per country and per United Nations geographical region, to enable an evaluation that takes into consideration different hierarchical perspectives. The results show that Eastern Asia, Western Europe and Northern America are the locations that have the highest number of systems. However, when it comes to accessibility, Northern America still has a very heterogeneous scenario, with a significant number of “Average” systems, while Asia and Europe together have more than half of the systems classified as “Very good” or “Fully accessible”. The presence of urban rail systems and the accessibility of those systems do not follow a strict pattern and some historical events are pointed to in order to try to explain the scenario. The study shows that there is still a long way to go when it comes to the accessibility of wheelchair users around the world and the lack of accessibility is not a problem only in developing countries. © 2021 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences},

abstract={The interaction with autonomous driving technology has increased in the past few years. Although a few studies have investigated the opinion of people who have physically experienced AVs, the understanding regarding how the experienced users can integrate AV-based services into real life is limited. To address this gap, the present study examines the travel characteristics of autonomous taxi trips and the determinants of continuous use intention. The data used in this study were collected in Guangzhou, China where paid autonomous taxi service have been publicly accessible and operated for one year. The analysis of the autonomous taxi trips revealed that this novel mobility choice has been accepted and extensively used by experienced users. In addition, five market segments were identified according to the supplement and alternative travel mode to autonomous taxi trips. Results indicate a possible mode shift from public transport to autonomous taxis. The role of a safety steward on board was also identified. Findings suggest that takeover action influences the acceptable time for fully autonomous driving and the preference for autonomous taxis. Certain factors—service satisfaction, psychological ownership, and concern for the equality of safety—for autonomous taxi use are considered in this study. On this basis, an extended technology acceptance model is proposed to explain the continuous use intention of autonomous taxis. The maintenance of a positive attitude toward use, which underlines the simplicity and usefulness of autonomous taxis and the improvement of service quality, is essential for experienced users. Furthermore, the approaches that establish psychological ownership and alleviate the concern for the equality of safety can also enhance the continuous use intention. Interestingly, the effect of concern for the equality of safety on continuous use intention is larger when experienced users do not or seldom encounter takeovers. The research contributes to the ongoing research related to the real-life application of AVs, with implications for urban transportation managers, mobility providers, and automobile industry players. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Past empirical studies indicated that there is a Kuznets or reverse U-shaped relationship between road deaths and per capita income, such that the number of road death increases at a low level of per capita reverse U-shaped relationship was observed between road injuries and per capita income. While these studies explored the impact of per capita income on road deaths and road injuries, no studies have examined the relationship between per capita income and road death to road injury ratio (DPI). Method: Using a fixed effects panel regression analysis from 67 countries spanning over a period of five decades (1960–2013), the present study sought to explore the impact of per capita gross domestic product (per capita GDP) on the DPI ratio and the underlying factors responsible for the relationship. Results: Our result suggests that per capita GDP followed a reverse U-shaped relationship with DPI. Moreover, the relative improvements in higher mobility roads as compared to improvements in higher accessibility roads, motorcycle ownership to passenger car ownership ratio, percentage of population living in an urban area, infant mortality rate, and the percentage of population below 15 years of age and above 64 years of age contributed to this relationship. Practical Applications: This implies that, at lower level of economic growth where road deaths exceed road injuries, countries should implement low-cost measures to combat road deaths cases. Such measures include mandating wearing of quality helmets and daytime running headlights for motorcycles. On the other hand, at higher level of economic growth where road injuries surpass road deaths, countries are encouraged to devote more resources to improving medical technology and services to treat road injury victims, mandating seatbelt use, as well as enhancing and promoting public transportation service. © 2021 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: The promotion of walking for transportation is a promising strategy to address not only the traffic bottlenecks or environmental pollution but also to provide health benefits to the patrons. Nevertheless, as enhancing active modes of transportation, including trips to and from shops-is easier in small or medium cities, it is quite a complex task in big urban areas. Methods: In the framework of the R + D + i DESPACIO project, in 2018, a street and online survey was carried out in the city of Madrid to gather information about different mobility habits, focusing on pedestrian mobility and on the respondents’ perceptions of issues related to mobility on foot. In order to promote more trips on foot, this study analyzed the factors influencing the walking route choice, other than distance. Some respondents also drew on a map the routes undertaken the previous day, indicating the trip purpose. Using the TransCAD software, the real factors that influenced the respondents when walking were obtained. Results: The key factors for selecting the walking routes were those linked to attractiveness (e.g., green areas, amenities, tourist attractions, etc.) and accessibility (e.g., obstacles, pavement width). The purpose of the trip did not change much the results, although they were accentuated when the trips were made for shopping. Conclusions: The applied methodology confirms that pedestrian streets, with green areas or access facility —and, hence, less noisy and polluted — were those enhancing a walking habit, and they were also the ones preferred by the citizens, who appreciated those attributes above the more classic ones of distance and time. Therefore, the street design and the pedestrian routes were found to be the most suitable to achieve healthier cities and citizens. © 2021},

abstract={Since the early 20th century, inventors have conceptualized 'plane cars' and other urban aerial transportation. Emerging innovations in electrification, automation, and other technologies are enabling new opportunities for on-demand air mobility, business models, and aircraft design. Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) 'flying car' concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on sustainability, social and economic impacts, airspace integration, and other topics. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a subset of advanced air mobility, is a concept that envisions safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation for passenger mobility, cargo delivery, and emergency management within or traversing a metropolitan area. In recent years, several companies have designed and tested enabling elements of this concept, including; prototypes of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, operational concepts, and market studies to understand potential business models. While UAM may be enabled by the convergence of several factors, a number of barriers such as weather could present challenges to scaling operations. This research discusses the potential weather and public acceptance challenges for operations in adverse conditions. This article presents a comprehensive seasonal and diurnal climatology analysis using historical observations across anticipated operational altitudes (surface- 5000 ft AGL) at ten metropolitan areas across the United States for the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). Public perceptions of weather-related societal barriers were evaluated through a five-city general population survey (n = 1,702) where respondents were asked about their views regarding flying in a small aircraft in a variety of adverse weather conditions using a six statement 5-point Likert scale. The results of the climatology analysis found weather most favorable in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with much less favorable conditions in Denver, New York City, and Washington D.C. In the future, equipping automated vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, and VTOLs with meteorological sensors coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence could enhance predictive capabilities that reduce flight cancellations and delays for travelers. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The inequalities that mark global society have been deepening worldwide. They materialize in cities, putting pressure on public transport systems for spatial and temporal supply, at the same time as mobility itself generates multifaceted inequalities. From empirical evidence of four socially and spatially distinct Brazilian cities — São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, and Fortaleza — we explore how differences in scale, geography, class, and race are related to spatial segregation, leading to different levels of access to jobs by public transport in the global peripheral context. These juxtaposed and combined inequalities create highly unfair and strongly cumulative effects on some social groups, contributing to the reproduction of inequality. Based on public and open data and combining methodologies of spatial analysis to enhance comparability and reproducibility, we explore different areal units, time thresholds, and metrics in order to examine transport inequalities in different urban contexts and refine our results. Upper classes have higher accessibility than lower classes, whites have higher accessibility than blacks, and large cities are more unequal than smaller ones. However, racial inequalities combine and overlap with class and city inequalities, changing these dichotomic notions when multiple dimensions are considered. The groups that polarize social hierarchy also polarize the urban space, since the white upper class and the black lower class are more segregated, but the way segregation interacts with accessibility is not straightforward and varies according to the socio-spatial structure. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={In sustainable urban mobility, the analysis of the daily life of citizens and mobility plans are being developed using data obtained through traditional methods like surveys. However, it is compulsory a new approach to study how citizens are moving in the city. In this context, the Arequipa Smart City research project developed a mobile application to gather geospatial data of the daily mobility of a group of university students. This work aims to discover urban mobility patterns using the information of the displacement data and the urban spaces represented by polygons. An important stage is to clean the data before to process and analyze the student' mobility data. The analysis of mobility patterns is supported by the duality conditions of space-time. The spatial conditions of the points of interest are analyzed using the geographic location of the students. From this analysis, we understand the demand for the use of urban spaces. Second, the temporal conditions are analyzed using stay time on urban space to discover the frequency of use of urban spaces. The results allow understanding the student's interaction with metropolitan urban spaces. In addition, we discuss the results to explain the importance of the analysis of smart mobility patterns in metropolitan areas to address urban accessibility. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid development of technology presents a new paradigm, one of which is in the transportation sector. The concept of smart mobility is one of the components in the realization of a smart city, which is closely related to the transportation sector. The Purwokerto-Purbalingga Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is the government's effort to encourage the transportation sector towards smart mobility. It requires three crucial categories: Accessibility, sustainability, and communication and information technology. This study proves and explains that these three categories can be fulfilled by the Purwokerto-Purbalingga Bus Rapid Transit, especially from women's perception, indicated by an average accessibility score of 4.04, sustainability of 4.22, and Information and Communication Technology of 3.80. Efforts that can be taken by the government and Bus Rapid Transit managers include monitoring and evaluating bus stops and bus arrival frequencies as well as developing mobile-based applications that provide real-time information related to bus rapid transit. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Much attention has been focused on the role of UAVs in wireless networking due to their increasing use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Until national laws allow unmanned aerial vehicles to fly independently, we will see large numbers of UAV swarms performing various tasks in the intelligent cities, including package delivery, facility management, event filming, monitoring and tracking. 5G/B5G mobile networks will benefit the UAV environment, and it can be used to enhance UAV communications in a variety of ways. UAVs' features of versatile mobility in 3D space, as well as autonomous operations and intelligent positioning, accommodate a wide range of wireless technologies and applications. This paper is meant to detail how 5G/B5G mobile systems and UAV technology merge to offer both enhanced aerial mobility and increased data capabilities for mobile users (UE). Cellularly linked UAVs play the role of cellular flying consumers, and are referred to as UAVs with a direct connection to consumers (a.k.a. UAV-UE, drone-UE, 5G-connected drone, or aerial user). This project's focus is to assemble an in-depth task analysis along with essential technical advancements in 5G/B5G and on-going field trial and prototyping work on cell-based UAVs. This report details recent developments within the 3GPP organisation and presents social and economic issues that must be taken into consideration before a successful introduction of this potentially useful technology. Accessible issues are already present and pave the way for future opportunities. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Service robot technology is progressing at a fast pace. Accurate robot-friendly indoor localization and harmonization of built environment in alignment with digital, physical, and social environment becomes emphasized. This paper proposes the novel approach of Robot Compatible Environment (RCE) within the architectural space. Evolution of service robotics in connection with civil engineering and architecture is discussed, whereas optimum performance is to be achieved based on robots’ capabilities and spatial affordances. For ubiquitous and safe human-robot interaction, robots are to be integrated into the living environment. The aim of the research is to highlight solutions for various interconnected challenges within the built environment. Our goal is to reach findings on comparison of robotic and accessibility standards, synthesis of navigation, access to information and social acceptance. Checklists, recommendations, and design process are introduced within the RCE framework, proposing a holistic approach. © 2021, Budapest University of Technology and Economics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Urban mobility makes it possible to incorporate new perspectives that make it possible to question and problematize the way in which social links and relations between city dwellers are shaped. In this way, mobility constitutes an increasingly massive, recurrent, and complex social practice, strongly conditioned by the existing levels of inequality and particularly those that entail processes of social exclusion. In the present research, the efficiency of the modality of adapted public transportation for people with disabilities in the city of León, Guanajuato, Mexico, which came into operation in 2012, receiving the 2019 Building Equality Award from the International Center for the Promotion of Human Rights and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is analyzed. The management, design, and implementation of Inclusive Urban Transportation (TÜI), demonstrated how the articulation of actors (public, private, and civil society) are of vital importance for the success of the project. In this sense, it is important to count on the permanent participation of focus groups that identify and understand the real needs of users with reduced mobility. The results achieved allow establishing an evaluation that contributes to detect and mitigate the conditions of vulnerability, risk, and segregation of people with disabilities. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Persons with disabilities who use power wheelchairs often have difficulty finding accessible routes to their destination from their outdoor location into the desired building or from their indoor location into another destination. This challenge can be alleviated through sensory information and preloaded map of the building and its surrounding outdoor areas. In this work, a power wheelchair system is integrated with a sensory suite and an autonomous control module to navigate the wheelchair in autonomous mode. A landmark-based autonomous navigation system using Quick Response (QR) code and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is used for automatic communication between the power wheelchair and various locations in a designated building. For the outdoor navigation system, Autonomous Wheelchair Indoor-Outdoor Navigation System (AWI-ONS) relies on GPS signals and Google Maps. For indoor navigation, QR codes are placed in several key locations inside and outside the building, such as parking lots and garages, doorways, offices, bathrooms, stores, elevators, accessible entrances, and passageways. When scanned by the onboard camera, the AWI-ONS downloads the building floorplan from the Firebase server for indoor navigation. The floor plan with QR code information generates a topological map that is made available to the user through a touch screen user interface (UI). The user can select the destination, and AWI-ONS will generate the most viable and accessible path to the desired location using modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The AWI-ONS is fitted with Ultrasound-based obstacle avoidance system that is designed to avoid a possible collision while navigating towards the destination. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={With a surge in the number of vehicles, urban traffic congestion has increased in recent years. This has led to increased travel times and decreased accessibility and mobility. One option to mitigate this issue is to promote the use of public transport, including buses. To encourage the use of buses, there is a need to provide reliable travel time and arrival information to commuters. In this study, we propose and develop predictive models to predict bus journey and arrival times based on historical AVL/GPS data, bus route and bus stop information. There were two parts to this study. The first was to predict overall journey times and the second was to predict bus arrival times at bus stops. To estimate total bus journey times, three models were developed using Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). Evaluation on a ground-truth dataset shows that LSTM outperformed the Linear Regression model and its performance was comparable to that of ANN. To predict bus arrival times at bus stops, three different models, namely Historical Averaging, Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting are proposed. Experimental results show that Gradient Boosting outperformed the other models and is more robust in predicting arrival times. Our study supports the idea that it is possible to predict bus journey time with reasonable accuracy using historical GPS observations and bus route information only. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Social infrastructure is provided to improve the quality of life of residents. There are two approaches to social infrastructure planning: (1) a population-based approach and (2) an access-based approach. A plan for the social infrastructure facilities in South Korea has been developed based on the population or number of households in a region. Recently, the South Korean government presented a guideline in which accessibility is included in the criteria. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation method for the accessibility of social infrastructure and for identifying residential areas with poor access. To obtain the travel time between the residence and the social infrastructure facility, we employed a navigation application programming interface that provides a travel time that reflects the resistances in an actual situation. The accessibility index (AI) is defined as a population-weighted average travel time. We also identified residential areas with poor access to social infrastructure by creating accessibility maps. This study includes social infrastructure facilities, such as parks, libraries, elementary schools, childcare centers, kindergartens, and sports facilities. The method proposed in this study was applied to Namdong-gu, Incheon Metropolitan City, South Korea, to evaluate its applicability. The proposed method has advantages in that (1) the AI is easy to understand because it represents an intuitive index for the overall accessibility in minutes of a region, and (2) accessibility maps effectively identify residential areas with poor access. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The recognition, by public authorities, of the shared nature of urban places and the extent and variety of disabling conditions associated with the emergence of phenomena of social exclusion and a steadily ageing population has motivated the creation of new legislation and strategic tools under the umbrella of inclusive design and accessibility for all. This study aims to show how the use of a new interactive accessibility instrument—the System of Accessible Itineraries (SIA)—can help decision-makers, municipality services and citizens to develop pedestrian-friendly networks in their cities. An in loco analysis of the main features, weaknesses, and potential of public spaces was undertaken within a selected survey area in the city of Porto, with the aim of improving the inclusiveness of public spaces. The integration of several concerns and regulations, pertaining to inclusiveness in the design of public spaces, into an easy-to-understand summary specific to this territory constitutes an important first step towards changing the existing paradigm. Apart from the inherent advantages to citizens with reduced mobility, the SIA also has the ability to inform urban planners concerning areas in need of intervention, prioritizing the execution of corrective actions within the public space. Additionally, due to the morphological similarity of the consolidated urban fabric of most Portuguese and European cities, the adopted interactive framework also reveals a considerable potential for comprehensive replication in many city centres, reducing the physical barriers, in a more integrative land strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Emerging transportation technologies such as ridesourcing services (i.e. Uber, Lyft, and Via) are disrupting the transportation sector and transforming public transit. Some transit observers envision future public transit to be integrated systems with fixed-route services running along major corridors and ridesourcing servicing lower-density areas. A switch from a conventional fixed-route service model to this kind of integrated Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) transit system, however, may elicit varied responses from residents. This paper evaluates traveler preferences for a proposed integrated MOD transit system versus the existing fixed-route system, with a particular focus on disadvantaged travelers. We conducted a survey in two low-income localities, namely, Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan. A majority of survey respondents preferred a MOD transit system over a fixed-route one. Results of ordered logit models revealed a stronger preference for MOD transit among males, college graduates, and individuals who currently receive inferior transit services and have used Uber/Lyft before. By contrast, preferences varied little by age, income, race, or disability status. Survey results further imply that low technology self-efficacy can be a more serious barrier for many people to adopt MOD transit than lacking access to bank accounts, smartphones, or the internet. The most important benefit of MOD transit perceived by respondents is enhanced accessibility to destinations, whereas their major concerns include the need to actively request rides, possible transit-fare increases, and potential technological failures. Addressing the concerns of female riders and accommodating the needs of less technology-proficient individuals should be priorities for transit agencies that are considering MOD initiatives. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Urban freight transport (UFT) poses as a challenge in historical cities given the impacts on cultural heritage. This paper presents retailers’ perceptions about urban freight transport in Brazilian historical cities, characterising current operations, identifying problems, and proposing measures for a sustainable urban freight transport. A survey was conducted in seven Brazilian cities to obtain data for the analysis. The research approach is based on descriptive statistics (characterisations of retailers and operations), a method of successive intervals (identifying the problem and freight policies), linear regression (urban delivery generation models), and ordered logit regression (influence of UFT-related problems on solutions). The results indicate that trade in these cities primarily consists of small and independent retailers (nanostores). Unloading zones is the most significant problem and the solutions suggested by retailers are not related with this problem. Moreover, ordered logit regression model showed that delivery time is the UFT-related problem with influence on the freight solutions. We proposed three measures to improve the mobility and accessibility of cargo in historical cities: transhipment areas, truck routes, and unloading bays. Results could support the sustainable urban freight transport in historical cities to preserve the historical heritage and, consequently, Brazil's memory. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urbanization’s rapid progress presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of “the death and life of cities” (a.k.a. “the essential diversity conditions for the urban built environment”). Despite the importance of activity diversity (i.e. serving different primary functions), existing works ignored that time diversity (i.e. attracting people at different times of the day) and space diversity (i.e. attracting people from different districts) also play important roles in promoting urban life in large cities. With assistance of human mobility and crowdsourcing data, this article thoroughly validates whether activity, time, and space diversity are essential and inseparable components of urban vitality in the Wuhan, China context. To achieve the goal, point of interest (POI) data are utilized to quantitatively measure activity diversity, human mobility data are adopted for building quantitative metrics of time diversity and space diversity, and a detailed urban perception map is crowdsourced as ground truth data for establishing a regression model between urban diversity indicators and urban vitality. The resultant regression model succeeds to decouple the relationship between population concentration, activity diversity, time diversity, space diversity, and urban vitality. It confirms that activity diversity together with time diversity and space diversity has stronger association with urban vitality than any single diversity indicator. Our contributions are threefold: (a) we provided a comprehensive collection of metrics for measuring urban diversity, (b) we confirmed that activity, time, and space diversity are essential components of urban vitality, and (c) our methodology can be replicated at scale to understand urban vitality under various geographic, societal, and economic contexts due to easy accessibility of similar datasets. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Rapid urbanization along with the population growth increases the pressure on existing transportation systems which boosts the needs for the provision of a well-connected and efficient Public Transport Systems (PTSs) to meet the mobility needs of the people. In this framework, it is important for the PTSs of a region to perform at certain quality levels including availability (both spatial and temporal), accessibility, affordability, environmental protection etc. Among all these features, the most important is the accessibility to stops since access to/from the public transport is provided only through them. This paper is focused on the development of a novel methodology to evaluate the accessibility of public transport at different levels of measurements of a region/city using Public Transport Accessibility Index (PTAI). It is developed based on the accessibility of public transport stops to the population, service centers and connectivity to nearby regions. The proposed approach is effective in terms of highlighting the least accessible areas towards the improvement of existing public transport connections or planning of new services.

abstract={The transportation demand in urban areas is driven by high mobility needs. However, in urban areas such as Jakarta, people propensity to use private transportation rather than public transportation even though modern public transportation is available. Consequently, the continued increase in the modal share of private vehicles was a matter of concern in the context of public transport services and the number of users. This paper wants to address this concern holistically by using the system dynamics approach. System dynamics is being used to developing a conceptual model of the dynamic complexity in Jakarta's transportation sector. By capturing the elements involved in the transportation system, this study also aims to capture key factors that may play significant roles in increasing services and the number of users. Such a holistic view could provide insights for possible effective measures that the government can take. The system diagram revealed the system's key components and stakeholders that involved in the transportation system in Jakarta. The Improvement of accessibility facilities and travel restrictions for private transport users is key points that need to be addressed properly to develop policy.

abstract={This paper presents a smart wheelchair, a customized version of a commercially available manual one. The motivation of this research was to support individuals with limited mobility in navigating their world. The proposed automated wheelchair consists of a stereo depth camera, LIDAR, DC gear motor, motor controller, joystick, emergency switch, processors, etc. The users have the option of controlling where their wheelchair goes by navigating themselves through the joystick or automatically through the developed hands-free application. This app relays back to the Jetson processor situated underneath the chair, which has the capability to move through any indoor location to reach the user's chosen destination. Although the initial research goal was to enable the wheelchair to navigate a patient through an indoor hospital facility, this low-cost, lightweight wheelchair is envisioned to be employed in all indoor locations and accessible by a broader range of users than just the wealthy few. The project's design files have been made available so that this open-source wheelchair can be reproduced publicly. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies offer new ways of interacting with digital media. However, such technologies are not well explored for people with different ranges of abilities beyond a few specific navigation and gaming applications. While new standardization activities are investigating accessibility issues with existing AR/VR systems, commercial systems are still confined to specialized hardware and software limiting their widespread adoption among people with disabilities as well as seniors. This proposal takes a novel approach by exploring the application of user model-based personalization for AR/VR systems to improve accessibility. The workshop will be organized by experienced researchers in the field of human computer interaction, robotics control, assistive technology, and AR/VR systems, and will consist of peer reviewed papers and hands-on demonstrations. Keynote speeches and demonstrations will cover latest accessibility research at Microsoft, Google, Verizon and leading universities. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Voice assistants (VAs) - like Amazon Alexa or Siri - ofer hands/eyes-free interactions that are benefcial to a range of users, including individuals who are blind, to fulfll tasks that are otherwise difcult or inaccessible. While these interfaces model conversational interactions to achieve simple tasks, there have been recent calls for VAs that model more transactional interactions for a wider range of complex activities. In this study, we explored the extension of VAs' capabilities in the context of indoor navigation through mixed-ability focus groups with blind and sighted airport travelers. We found high overlap in the difculties encountered by blind and sighted travelers, as well as shared interest in a voice-activated travel assistant to improve travel experiences. Leveraging user-elicited recommendations, we present interaction design examples that showcase customization of diferent and multiple modalities, which collectively demonstrate how VAs can more broadly achieve transactional interactions in complex task scenarios. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The widening income gap in post-reform China has given rise to social inequality. Among those, transport poverty and inequality have significantly affected the daily life of low-income groups. While important, this is an under-researched topic in China. This gap in the academic literature is glaring given the country’s urbanization rates, sprawling cities and income differentials. Most previous studies have only focused on two aspects of transport poverty—job-housing imbalance and accessibility. A comprehensive understanding of the causes and impacts of transport inequality is currently lacking. Therefore, a systematic review of academic literature based on keywords relevant to transport poverty in China was conducted to provide a more complete assessment of the situation in Chinese cities. In total, 62 relevant studies were identified after close examination of the articles (including titles, abstracts, and full-texts). This set of articles allowed a number of general patterns to be identified. It was found that the most common causes of transport poverty include: a lack of access to private vehicles; uneven access to alternative transport options; inadequate public transport provision; jobs-housing imbalance; and the hukou system (a system of household registration which aims to regulate population distribution and rural-to-urban migration). The main impacts of transport poverty include: curtailed mobility and longer travel times; higher household expenditures on travel; reduced access to jobs and essential services; higher household expenditures on travel; and health and environmental issues. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Mobility can be defined as the ability of people to move, live and interact with the space. In this context, indoor mobility, in terms of indoor localization and wayfinding, is a relevant topic due to the challenges it presents, in comparison with outdoor mobility, where GPS is hardly exploited. Knowing how to move in an indoor environment can be crucial for people with disabilities, and in particular for blind users, but it can provide several advantages also to any person who is moving in an unfamiliar place. Following this line of thought, we employed an inclusive by design approach to implement and deploy a system that comprises an Internet of Things infrastructure and an accessible mobile application to provide wayfinding functions, targeting the University community. As a real word case study, we considered the University of Bologna, designing a system able to be deployed in buildings with different configurations and settings, considering also historical buildings. The final system has been evaluated in three different scenarios, considering three different target audiences (18 users in total): i. students with disabilities (i.e., visual and mobility impairments); ii. campus students; and iii. visitors and tourists. Results reveal that all the participants enjoyed the provided functions and the indoor localization strategy was fine enough to provide a good wayfinding experience. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In recent years, we have assisted with an impressive advance in augmented reality systems and computer vision algorithms, based on image processing and artificial intelligence. Thanks to these technologies, mainstream smartphones are able to estimate their own motion in 3D space with high accuracy. In this paper, we exploit such technologies to support the autonomous mobility of people with visual disabilities, identifying pre-defined virtual paths and providing context information, reducing the distance between the digital and real worlds. In particular, we present ARIANNA+, an extension of ARIANNA, a system explicitly designed for visually impaired people for indoor and outdoor localization and navigation. While ARIANNA is based on the assumption that landmarks, such as QR codes, and physical paths (composed of colored tapes, painted lines, or tactile pavings) are deployed in the environment and recognized by the camera of a common smartphone, ARIANNA+ eliminates the need for any physical support thanks to the ARKit library, which we exploit to build a completely virtual path. Moreover, ARIANNA+ adds the possibility for the users to have enhanced interactions with the surrounding environment, through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to recognize objects or buildings and enabling the possibility of accessing contents associated with them. By using a common smartphone as a mediation instrument with the environment, ARIANNA+ leverages augmented reality and machine learning for enhancing physical accessibility. The proposed system allows visually impaired people to easily navigate in indoor and outdoor scenarios simply by loading a previously recorded virtual path and providing automatic guidance along the route, through haptic, speech, and sound feedback. © 2021 by the authors.

By using a common smartphone as a mediation instrument with the environment, ARIANNA+ leverages augmented reality and machine learning for enhancing physical accessibility. The proposed system allows visually impaired people to easily navigate in indoor and outdoor scenarios simply by loading a previously recorded virtual path and providing automatic guidance along the route, through haptic, speech, and sound feedback.},

abstract={United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 11 aims to promote inclusiveness and sustainable urbanization, such that cities can become productive and accessible places for attracting talent, encouraging innovation, and creating economic growth. SDG Target 11.2 specifically mentions urban transport. Localizing SDG Target 11.2 involves city governments ensuring a public transport (PT) system that has at least two dimensions of accessibility: physical and economic. This translates to ensuring barrier-free physical access to the PT system, as well as affordable fares for using the PT system. This study presents a process for operationalizing the SDG Target 11.2 indicator for small cities in India. The study focuses on addressing physical access to quality public transport system. Presently, the commuters in these cities are dependent on intermediate PT (IPT) systems to meet their mobility needs. Small cities lack a detailed database for planning PT systems. Master plans are generally prepared by planning authorities to guide the future development of cities; however, the master plan documents lack discussion and vision for future mobility, as required by SDG Target 11.2. This study concludes that the current indicator for SDG Target 11.2 requires modification to ensure SDG-compliant PT systems in small cities. An integrated IPT and PT system is required to improve access to high-quality PT systems, in line with SDG Target 11.2. © 2021},

abstract={At the moment, urban mobility research and governmental initiatives are mostly focused on motor-related issues, e.g. the problems of congestion and pollution. And yet, we cannot disregard the most vulnerable elements in the urban landscape: pedestrians, exposed to higher risks than other road users. Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN's 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. The proposed framework should be taken as a complement to the work of urban planners and public authorities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Tricity is a specific area in Poland because of the geographical location, landscape, access to the sea, access to a few container terminals and being an agglomeration. That is why both for inhabitants and local businesses city logistics issues are particularly important. The need for more sustainable transportation and integrative planning processes in cities, has been widely developed since 2013 when Urban Mobility Package set up a concept for SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans) Within this idea, EU provides financial support for urban mobility projects. So various city logistics’ solutions are implemented but with a different level of success. City logistics measures have in fact their weaknesses and strengths. It is rather challenging to find an optimal solution because it is difficult to take into account the complexity and diversity of urban logistics while keeping all sides engaged. City logistics seems to be a quite difficult issue, mostly because it contains several levels of complexity. Not only it refers to the diversity of the goods transported and heterogeneity of the transportation means, but also involves multiple stakeholders. The most important are authorities, transportation operator, retailers and residents. These stakeholders most often represent different aims and priorities. While local authorities are interested in reducing pollution, congestion or noise, transportation operators and retailers are mainly focused on keeping costs under control while maintaining service levels. In the study, in-depth interviews technique with various stakeholders of city logistics was used. The interview was based on a questionnaire consisting of open and closed questions. One scale question assessed the importance of a given dimension of sustainable urban logistics for the particular stakeholder. This approach made it possible to identify the priorities of individual stakeholder groups. The respondents were a few individual stakeholders for each group identified within the literature review. To address the aim of the study, to analyse gathered data, both qualitative and quantitative methods were implemented. Among the qualitative methods, the Delphi method, text analysis and text mining techniques were used to identify the main characteristics of stakeholders opinions. Then, to draw the detailed results for each group, the Kruskal-Wallis test was held, equivalent to ANOVA, but not requiring normal distribution of variables, impossible to achieve at small sizes of stakeholder groups samples. The Kruskal-Wallis test allowed identifying similarities and differences between the priorities of the studied groups in light of the research problem being examined. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Street functional classification comprises a principal element of urban road networks. However, the conventional approach that has dominated urban and transport planning, has given main priority on car movement. This condition lead to significant negative impacts on cities such as major severances to the urban fabric, low multimodality level, inaccessible road environment for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, it is clear that we should embark into a new hierarchy system, enhancing and supporting sustainable transport modes. The current research intends to develop a method that determines the strategic road network of a metropolitan region based on a multicriteria analysis process (MCA). More specifically, at first, we created 3 alternatives of re-defining the current strategic road network of the study area. These alternatives propose 3 different strategic network classifications according to several parameters; i) connectivity properties, ii) route position in the road network, iii) urban interest, iv) existence of major public transport lines and metropolitan cycling routes, as well as v) their existing classification condition. Afterwards, we evaluate these alternatives using multicriteria analysis (REGIME method) in order to choose the most efficient one. The evaluation process uses various criteria which cover a considerable range of urban and transport issues. The selected alternative adopts a two-dimensional matrix approach, which addresses the significance of the routes and the modes prioritized. The method is applied to the metropolitan area of Athens in Greece. It is worth noting that the selected alternative can bring about notable benefits for the Greek capital, such as increase of walking, cycling and public transport share, improvement of traffic safety level, greener mobility (less GHG emissions and energy consumption), enhancement of the urban realm, better accessibility and coherence of the urban fabric. The method proposed, is a human-oriented planning tool which provides priority to sustainable modes and could be replicated to other areas with similar characteristics as well. © 2020 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences},

abstract={The increasingly prevalent concept of inclusiveness in the public discourse is gaining a foothold in the paradigm shift of street design from a predominance of vehicular traffic towards a vision that caters to non-motorised modes and creates an urban setting conducive to non-mobile activities. This study aims to investigate perceived importance within a set of six dimensions of street design (i.e., accessibility, connectivity, streetscape, safety and security, urban vibrancy, and greenery), which is an inclusive street vision and can be contextualised in the act of visioning. A street-intercept questionnaire survey (n = 816) was conducted in Singapore, and gender, age and transport mode use information were also collected. Using a multivariate and graphical approach, a categorical canonical correlation analysis was performed that highlighted the elderly and motorcyclists as groups with potentially different perceptions. Then, univariate ordinal logistic regression models were fitted separately on the six dimensions; gender was non-significant, while age and certain transport modes were significant. In particular, in addition to age, the car passenger transport mode was significant in five dimensions. Recent developments in Singapore’s urban transport, which is undergoing rapid changes due to incremental improvement schemes and disruptive services, such as ride hailing and bicycle sharing, are further discussed. As mobility needs and desirable street qualities vary across transport modes, this study serves as a precursor of further research into specific inclusive street dimensions, such as streetscape and urban vibrancy. The results indicate that land use and transport systems should be planned or redeveloped collaboratively to incorporate users’ aspirations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Unassisted wayfinding is a fundamental need but has been challenging for persons with visual disabilities(PVDs). Wayfinding in healthcare facilities is even more challenging because of additional mental stress. This work proposes a novel framework to address information needs for wayfinding and physical accessibility. This work is based on an immersion in the proposed healthcare facility keeping PVDs as the prime focus. The studied healthcare journey consists of three major tasks for visitors, i.e. registration, consultation, and follow-up (RCF). Access to information when required in time and space is a critical need for these tasks. We propose a generic framework to create and update the required information and can be easily adapted to other public facilities. It provides an easy annotation interface to create a navigation map. Information requirement was derived through a comprehensive survey of existing standards and a set of interviews with stakeholders. We developed an 'IncluNav' application to provide turn by turn navigation instruction by integrating bluetooth beacons and smartphone's inertial sensor data. The application provides both visual and audio instructions based on visitors' choice and location. Limited testing has shown the effectiveness of annotation tool in the creation, update, and release of accessible digital maps. Our limited field testing shows that the 'IncluNav' application is capable of providing critical information including wayfinding directions to a diverse set of visitors resulting in an improved journey experience. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Reading and following visual signs remains the predominant mechanism for navigation and receiving wayfinding information in areas without accurate GPS coverage. This puts people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) at a great disadvantage. There still remains a great need to provide a low-cost, easy to use, and reliable auxiliary wayfinding system within indoor and outdoor spaces that complements existing satellite-based systems. Through both a user study and a quantitative study of GPS accuracies in outdoor environments, this paper highlights the need for auxiliary outdoor wayfinding tools for people with visual impairments. A deep learning-based image localization framework called PathLookup is proposed in this work for accurately providing path advancement information for outdoor wayfinding. Evaluation results show PathLookup to be highly accurate and fast potentially proving to be a valuable tool for future integration into outdoor wayfinding systems. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={GPS accuracy is poor in indoor environments and around buildings. Thus, reading and following signs still remains the most common mechanism for providing and receiving wayfinding information in such spaces. This puts individuals who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) at a great disadvantage, and thus, there remains a great need to provide a low-cost, easy to use, and reliable wayfinding system within indoor and outdoor spaces that complements existing satellite-based systems. This work designs, implements, and evaluates a wayfinding system and smartphone application called CityGuide that can be used by BVI individuals to navigate their surroundings beyond what is possible with just a GPS-based system. CityGuide enables an individual to query and get turn-by-turn shortest route directions from an indoor location to an outdoor location. CityGuide leverages recently developed indoor wayfinding solutions in conjunction with GPS signals to provide a seamless indoor-outdoor navigation and wayfinding system that guides a BVI individual to their desired destination through the shortest route. Evaluations of CityGuide with BVI human subjects navigating between an indoor starting point to an outdoor destination within an unfamiliar university campus scenario showed it to be effective in reducing end-to-end navigation times and distances of almost all participants. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Transportation planning, as one of the essential parts of city planning, has the potential to solve many problems on a global scale. These problems can be listed as traffic congestion, air pollution, fossil-fuel consumption, accessibility problems, global warming, climate change, and psychological problems affecting human lives. In recent years, transportation planning studies have come to the fore within the concept of sustainable urban mobility. The focus of this research is e-scooter systems, one of the micromobility options within the scope of urban mobility. The study explores how the availability of this micro transport mode can affect the time, cost, and ease of travels. In order to get information about the applications in Turkey, provider representatives were interviewed, and mobile applications and expert opinions were consulted. © 2021, IGI Global.},

abstract={Worldwide, waterborne transport is the most efficient choice for moving goods in terms of tonnes per kilometer. In Europe, especially in the Nordic countries, it is a relevant mobility means for passenger traffic too, used mainly for commuting activities. Most of the vessels operating on coastal and inland waterways, for either goods or passenger transport, are equipped with conventional diesel powertrains that negatively affect the environment and endanger the well-being of the population that live and work in their immediate surroundings. Through legislation and funding programs, electrification of ferries and larger vessels has already begun and should contribute to the achievement of carbon neutral shipping in Europe by 2050. The integration of electrified vessels into existing mobility systems and urban infrastructure to optimize passenger journeys and cargo transport represents an additional challenge. With the use case of the coastal city of Stavanger, this paper presents an approach to identify and evaluate mobility services and accessibility issues with the purpose of enhancing intermodality between waterborne and landside passenger transport. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The aspirations of public administrations to meet quality parameters and standards in urban spaces have fostered new strategies and tools that allow users to give safety and well-being. The participation and interaction of different actors during decision-making in the context of allocation of public resources implies a significant degree of complexity when prioritizing actions in public works. The objective of the study focuses on obtaining an urban street condition index (USCI) that allows an efficient diagnosis of urban infrastructure. The study provides an innovation component for decision-making through the construction of guidelines to prioritize spending on investment in urban infrastructure. The case study has been developed in three countries, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina (Triple Border) with the aim of drawing management guidelines during the process in public entities. The results for Brazil and Argentina present streets with satisfactory USCI. Paraguay reflects a significant lack of urban infrastructure and compliance of accessibility regulations. Regarding the city of Foz de Iguazú, it has been observed that 50% of the roads require prevailing actions to improve the mobility of the roads; 40% of these reflect reduced mobility and deterioration of urban components, configured as an urgent action, and only 10% of the roads studied reflect adequate mobility conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={This paper examines the effects of transport accessibility on residential satisfaction and moving intention when travel mode choice is limited. It uses the case of Yangon City in Myanmar, where bus is the dominant transport mode, automobile dependence is low, and the use of two-wheel vehicle is restricted in some areas of the city. These characteristics altogether indicate that the potential bias arising from the unobserved differences in people's travel mode preferences can be minimized. Based on a sample of about 5,200 residents living close to bus stops, structural equation modeling is used to test the effects of objective and subjective measures of bus stop accessibility on residential satisfaction and moving intention. The results show that high perceived bus stop accessibility—not short distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop—is associated with high residential satisfaction, and neither measures of bus stop accessibility is associated with moving intention. These findings indicate that the perception of bus stop accessibility matters for residential satisfaction rather than the actual distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop, and the low satisfaction with bus stop accessibility is not expected to induce households to consider moving to a new residence or location. The actual distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop has the strongest influence on perceived bus stop accessibility, followed by the satisfaction with neighborhood's safety and security, holding household characteristics constant. From a policy perspective, the findings underscore the relevance of including subjective measures of accessibility in designing or improving the accessibility of transport systems. To aid planning, there is a need to explore the objective factors that underlie people's satisfaction with transport accessibility. Moreover, an integrated housing and transport policy could bring significant gains to residents, as desirable neighborhood features are associated with not only high perceived bus stop accessibility but also high residential satisfaction and low moving intention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: This paper explores the challenges that people who use wheeled mobility devices face navigating unfamiliar pedestrian environments. The intent is to understand their decisions during the planning and travel phases and to compare these decisions and experiences between mobility device users. Methods: Fourteen mobility device users (4 manual wheelchair, 6 power wheelchair, and 4 scooter users) completed surveys that captured data about socio-economic and disability status, mobility device skills and confidence, and wayfinding abilities. As part of a wheeling interview, participants planned trips to three destinations in an unfamiliar urban setting. They wore a GoPro camera affixed to their head and carried a global positioning system device as they wheeled to each destination. During each trip, participants answered questions regarding their decisions and experiences. At the end of each route, participants rated the physical and mental demand of the trip and rated their own performance using the NASA-TLX questionnaire. They also completed wayfinding skills tests of their spatial orientation and ability to estimate distance and slope. Transcripts of the videos were coded and analyzed using interpretive description. Spatial and qualitative data were then uploaded into a geographical information system to identify patterns in decision making and experiences and compare across mobility devices. Results: The findings highlight the complex and dynamic challenges faced by wheeled mobility device users and the implications on their mobility. The findings emphasize the relationship between the individual, the mobility device, and the environment to shape navigational experiences. Manual wheelchair users appeared to struggle more with navigation because accessibility issues diverted their attention away from maintaining orientation and heading. Conclusions: Wheeled mobility device users face challenges navigating unfamiliar environments that make reaching destinations difficult which may deter community participation. Environments that incorporate their diverse and unique requirements should be considered in urban design and research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the development of smart cities, Internet services will be pervasively accessible for moving vehicles. It is envisioned that the video content demand of vehicles will explode in the near future. However, the strategy to efficiently distribute video content in large-scale vehicular networks is still absent due to challenges arising from the huge video population, heavy bandwidth consumption, heterogeneous user devices, and vehicles' mobility. In this work, we propose to collaboratively replicate video content on Roadside Units (RSUs) to enhance video distribution services based on the fact that the contact period between moving vehicles and a single RSU is not long enough to complete video downloading. In our design, a video file is split into multiple chunks. Each RSU replicates a small number of original chunks and chunks encoded by network coding. Replicating encoded chunks can reduce redundancy of chunks on different RSUs so that RSUs can complement each other better, whereas original chunks can be transrated to chunks with lower bitrates flexibly to fit in users' devices. Therefore, we replicate both original and encoded chunks on RSUs to take advantages of both sides. Stochastic models are employed to analyze chunk download processes and a convex optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimal partition of space allocated to each kind of chunks. Furthermore, we extend our strategy to support video streaming services and empirically prove that the influence caused by limitations of network coding is moderate. In the end, we conduct extensive simulations which not only validate the accuracy of our models but also demonstrate that our strategy can effectively boost video distribution services. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Transport can play a key role in mitigating climate change, through reducing traffic, emissions and dependency on private vehicles. Transport is also crucial to connect remote areas to central or urban areas. Yet, sustainable and flexible transport is among the greatest challenges for rural areas and rural-urban regions. Innovative transport concepts and approaches are urgently needed to foster sustainable and integrated regional development. This article addresses challenges of sustainability, accessibility, and connectivity through examining complementary systems to existing public transport, including demand-responsive transport and multimodal mobility. We draw upon case studies from the Metropolitan Area of Styria, Ljubljana Urban Region and ruralWales (GUSTmobil, REGIOtim, EURBAN, Bicikelj, Bwcabus, Grass Routes). In-depth analysis through a mixed-methods case study design captures the complexity behind these chosen examples, which form a basis for analysing the effects of services on accessibility for different groups, connectivity to public transport and usability as a "first and last mile” feeder. We further explore the weaknesses of complementary transport systems, including legal, organisational and financial barriers, and offer potential solutions to structure and communicate complementary transport systems to improve access and use. Looking ahead, we use the case studies to anticipate innovative, sustainable "mobility as a service” (MaaS) solutions within and between urban and rural areas and consider how future public policy orientations and arrangements can enable positive change. A main concern of our article and the contribution to scientific literature is through exploring the benefit of well-established multi-level governance arrangements when introducing smaller-scale mobility solutions to improve rural-urban accessibility. It becomes clear that not a one-size-fits-all model but placed-based and tailored approaches lead to successful and sustainable concepts. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

funding_text 1={Bwcabus, operated in partnership between local authorities and the Welsh Government, covers three predominantly rural counties: Carmarthenshire (pop. 187,568), Ceredi-gion (pop. 72,992) and Pembrokeshire (pop. 125,055). Fares are charged by distance, but external funding remains necessary to sustain and expand services. Bwcabus has received funding from the ERDF, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), Welsh Government, local authorities and the University of South Wales as a sponsoring partner. Grass Routes is operated by Monmouthshire County Council (pop. 92,142), with grant support from the Welsh Government. The service is subsidised, enabling a flat-rate fare system. Grass Routes costs approximately £530,000 per year to operate, and provides 58,000 annual passenger journeys [85]. The Grass Routes fleet is also used for school transport, reducing costs through shared resources.},

funding_text 3={The basis of the REGIOtim project is ‘tim’, an existing model of multimodal mobility in the City of Graz, developed by Holding Graz [74]. The name ‘tim’ abbreviates and combines the German words ‘täglich.intelligent.mobil’ (daily.intelligent.mobility). The tim concept was developed in 2015 within the project KombiMo II [74], funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology. The roll-out of REGIOtim began in 2017 through a cooperation between the Regional Management, the City of Graz and Holding Graz. The first location in a peripheral municipality was implemented through the Interreg Central Europe project “Peripheral Access” [75]. Further REGIOtim nodes are funded by the European Regional Development Fund (EFRE/IWB) and the regional budget.},
funding_text 4={Local transport is administered by the municipalities and funded by the revenue generated from the fees, as well as the municipal and state subsidies. In Ljubljana Urban Region, the Ljubljana Public Transport Utility (Ljubljanski potniški promet) that is owned by the Municipality of Ljubljana is the main player, but there are several other transport companies (e.g., Arriva/Kam-bus) involved in local transport. The railway passenger transport is relatively weak and entirely managed by the state, but it is large enough to be considered when planning the transport development. The Local Transport Plans/Sustainable Mobility Plans are the key planning documents, and the small size of municipalities is the main obstacle for improved transport planning, especially between urban municipalities which can organise more financially viable urban and peri-urban transport, and more rural municipalities. However, EU funds (predominantly European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)) are used for the funding of activities and mobility infrastructure, while participation in various international projects, such as INTERREG, provided new ideas and opportunities to exchange experience and know-how. Newer forms of mobility, such as shared-hailed taxis, are mostly in a pilot phase and sources of funding for their long-term operation are being developed.},
funding_text 5={While inter-regional transport, including rail and long-distance bus services, is sponsored and administered by the Welsh Government, local public transport is typically governed by the relevant local authority. Local authorities develop transport strategies, procure services, and issue contracts to commercial providers. The Transport (Wales) Act also enables the Welsh Government to give financial assistance to local authorities in order to facilitate transport, primarily through the Bus Services Support Grant. While most of this funding goes to public transport, some is ringfenced for community transport. Local authorities provide subsidies to transport services as a public good; this is particularly important in rural areas where many routes are otherwise not financially viable. In some cases, local authorities directly provide transport services themselves.},

abstract={There are about 285 million visually impaired people in the world. Though they manage to do their daily chores, with support but face many difficulties. The proposed solution provides indoor and outdoor assistance to the visually impaired. Conventionally they generally use a cane for proper and hassle-free navigation. The system would aid them with a routine task like walking, aid while writing, going up and down the stairs, searching for common objects like keys, brushes, chairs, etc. Voice-based aid would be provided to them through speakers and sensors. The ultrasonic sensor helps in recognizing objects within the vicinity which might not be captured by the cameras and produce an alerting sound for the user to avoid any sudden bump. This system will be comparatively economical and accessible. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Just a couple of years ago, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) were available only for a narrow group of users. Currently, with the outbreak of mobile devices, they are accessible to anyone and everywhere. Urban navigation or searching for POIs (Points of Interest) had become an everyday activity. With the availability of consumer electronics and wireless technologies, each user can obtain information considering his or her location even in an unknown environment. Additionally, network operators and service providers utilize this location-based information for monitoring and maintenance purposes. This paper is focused on a study, considering the DOP (Dilution of Precision) and pseudorange error estimation in case of Androidpowered smartphones operating outdoors. It describes a measurement campaign, carried out in varying urban environments, with two types of excursions (by car and bicycle), including two popular consumer devices from different manufacturers. Based on this, respective conclusions and remarks are given. This work aims to aid not only users, but also application developers as well as device manufacturers and retailers, when it comes to providing precise and reliable products and services. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Carsharing has become a trend in the transport industry that has been growing exponentially in recent years and gaining popularity in large cities in Europe and Asia such as Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam, among others. This work presents an implementation of a carsharing system that activates all the car's functionalities through an application without the need for additional elements such as cards, physical keys, etc. Likewise, being able to connect the car and mobile application through an IoT device and backed by a cloud infrastructure, it offers a new mobility modality that unites technology, in the city of Lima that is flexible, safe and affordable for most of the people; in addition to bringing to Peru the concepts of shared economy and uberization of things. We present that in Lima there is a very deplorable, disorderly and low-quality urban transport system generating many problems for users. The first alternative solution would be to acquire a private car, but for many people it is not accessible, especially for people between 20 and 45 years old, since it entails having a large budget that includes the cost of the car, maintenance, security permits, among others, that many people do not have in their entirety. We report such as Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Applications Mobile, with an innovative technological architecture with new advances in the automotive field, such as electric cars. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Smart Cities have a high quality of life determined by several variables with renewable transport networks, protection and health, open space connectivity, and other critical facilities. The key elements of smart city classification are transportation, traffic management, and parking. Among those elements, the intelligent transportation system plays a vital role. Big data analytics can create smart cities to achieve a smart transport system, autonomous vehicles, and crowdsourcing. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread quickly through China since December 2019 and later globally. As this article was written, the disease was reported to globally infect 100 countries. Evening transmission from person to person is a practical approach for controlling and preventing the epidemic. Specific everyday tasks, such as logistics that move goods in our daily lives, ultimately require interaction between men. Using an automated logistic vehicle has been the preferred option for achieving the contactless transportation of goods. This chapter describes Hercules, an autonomous logistic vehicle used to move goods without touch during the outbreak of COVID-19. The vehicle shall be equipped for autonomous navigation capability. The research introduces the mechanism for smart charging of shared autonomous electric vehicles. Researchers include information on the hardware and software and the algorithms for achieving autonomous navigation, including vision, planning, and control. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are believed to provide many profits for individuals and society, with increased road safety, reduced traffic congestion, and an improved ecological footprint. However, many barriers still hinder the widespread acceptance of autonomous driving. During this pandemic situation, decision-making towards adopting autonomous driving imposes a more accessible and reliable way to deliver things, such as food and medical supplies, in an emergency than policymakers and automakers have devoted in recent years. Innovative AVs emerge as potential energy savers in the transportation system. There is a cumulative emphasis on AVs together in terms of rapid technological advances and evaluating these technologies and their significant effects on society and transportation systems during COVID-19 around the world. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.},

abstract={A topical overview of the issues facing automated driving systems and Mobility as a Service, identifies the obstacles to implementation and offers potential solutions Advances in cooperative and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, cultural and socio-economic shifts, measures to combat climate change, social pressures to reduce road deaths and injuries, and changing attitudes toward self-driving cars, are creating new and exciting mobility scenarios worldwide. However, many obstacles remain and are compounded by the consequences of COVID-19. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) integrates various forms of public and private transport services into a single on-demand mobility service. Combining trains, cars, buses, bicycles, and other forms of transport, MaaS promises a convenient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly alternative to private automobiles. Automated Vehicles and MaaS: Removing the Barriers is an up-to-date overview of the contemporary challenges facing CAVs and MaaS. Written in a clear and accessible style, this timely volume summarizes recent research studies, describes the evolution of automated driving systems and MaaS, identifies the barriers to their widespread adoption, and proposes potential solutions to overcome and remove these barriers. The text focuses on the claims, realities, politics, new organizational roles, and implementation problems associated with CAVs and MaaS—providing industry professionals, policymakers, planners, administrators, and investors with a clear understanding of the issues facing the introduction of automated driving systems and MaaS. This important guide and reference: Provides an overview of recent progress, the current state of the art, and discussion of future objectives Presents both technical background and general overview of automated driving systems and MaaS Covers political, commercial, and practical issues, as well as technical and research content, yet suitable for non-specialists Helps readers make informed decisions and realistic estimates for implementing mobility solutions and new business models for transport services Includes an extensive bibliography with direct links to in-depth technical engineering and research information Automated Vehicles and MaaS: Removing the Barriers is an essential resource for transport providers, vehicle manufacturers, urban and transport planners, students of transportation, vehicle technology, and urban planning, and transport policy and strategy managers, advisors, and reviewers. © 2021 JohnWiley & Sons Ltd.

abstract={The majority of blind people require assistance when navigating through unfamiliar places due to a lack of information about the building structure and encounterable obstacles. To address this aspect of the problem, this paper presents "Navigate-Me"as an approach for indoor navigation with maximum accessibility, usability, and security, reducing the problems that the user might encounter while navigating through indoor environments. As the targeted audience of this paper is blind or visually impaired people, Navigate-Me utilizes voice-based inputs from the user. In addition, this paper includes Bluetooth beacon integration for localization, White Cane with sensors for obstacle detection, a machine learning model for voice authentication, and an algorithm protocol for a secure connection between server and application integration-driven architecture to assist the visually impaired in navigating known and unknown indoor environments. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={People navigating in unfamiliar buildings take advantage of myriad visual, spatial and semantic cues to efficiently achieve their navigation goals. Towards equipping computational agents with similar capabilities, we introduce Pathdreamer, a visual world model for agents navigating in novel indoor environments. Given one or more previous visual observations, Pathdreamer generates plausible high-resolution 360◦ visual observations (RGB, semantic segmentation and depth) for viewpoints that have not been visited, in buildings not seen during training. In regions of high uncertainty (e.g. predicting around corners, imagining the contents of an unseen room), Pathdreamer can predict diverse scenes, allowing an agent to sample multiple realistic outcomes for a given trajectory. We demonstrate that Pathdreamer encodes useful and accessible visual, spatial and semantic knowledge about human environments by using it in the downstream task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Specifically, we show that planning ahead with Pathdreamer brings about half the benefit of looking ahead at actual observations from unobserved parts of the environment. We hope that Pathdreamer will help unlock model-based approaches to challenging embodied navigation tasks such as navigating to specified objects and VLN. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={Digital geographic platforms like Google Maps or Bing Maps provide user-friendly interfaces for navigating through cities. Although, these apps are used daily for shortest paths calculation within the urban centers, they were designed with an emphasis on the needs of motor vehicles and therefore pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option. For that reason, current pedestrian navigation services provide routes based on road networks as they are well defined due to the popularity of car navigation systems on one hand and the lack of pedestrian data (including streets, sidewalks, curb ramps, elevation data, and construction permit information) on the other hand. However, road networks do not adequately represent the paths that pedestrians use. Furthermore, for people with limited mobility, planning a route using a wheelchair in urban centers is very difficult due to lack of information regarding accessibility along the route. To this end, better data on pedestrian sections are needed to improve safety, comfort, and convenience of pedestrian movement. This process requires a carefully developed methodology for modeling pedestrian routes. This paper introduces a structured approach to develop a simple model of pedestrian data that captures all required information and facilitates the design of user-friendly interactive navigation systems. A pilot case is presented for the historical center of Thessaloniki city. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={Efficient shortest path algorithms are central to routing and navigation applications. However, finding the shortest path is often not adequate for urban sidewalk routes, as users of these applications may also be interested in alternative routes that, although slightly longer, have other desirable features and properties (i.e., accessibility, safety, comfort, and convenience). The k-shortest paths (KSP) represent an ordered list of the available alternative routes. Even though several KSP algorithms have been proposed, to our knowledge, there is no research considering all these issues. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a heuristic algorithm that uses a penalty method by increasing certain edge weights, to effectively search for the most accessible alternative paths for multi-route cases in navigation systems. We then present experimental results on finding the most accessible paths in pedestrian sections of the historical center of Thessaloniki city. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={The mobility choice of university students represents one of the most interesting issue within the scientific literature of the sector, considering the impacts that these choices might have on congestion. In all the European cities where cycling mobility and bike sharing are experiencing a continuous growth, mobility policies have fostered the use of these transport alternatives. The bicycle, in the period between the end of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century, was the mostly chosen means of transport thanks to its characteristics of cheapness and elasticity in use. However, with the continuous technological development, the use of bicycles has increasingly reduced in favor of a mobility based mainly on private cars and motorcycles. The progressive deterioration of the livability of urban centers and neighboring areas has led public administrations of northern Europe to an overall reorganization of the transport system. The key words of the reorganization of transport are: "sustainable transport", "intermodality", "traffic calming". In this context, urban mobility policies have focused on fostering the use of bicycles at the urban level, increasing bike sharing in cities. In the city of Naples no initiative is promoted to make bike sharing accessible within university areas. In 2016 a new engineering hub was inaugurated located in San Giovanni a Teduccio, an Eastern borough of the city of Naples. The neighboring municipalities have proposed the idea of encouraging the use of bicycles to reach this hub. Among them there is the city of Portici, one of the most densely inhabited areas in the territory (with 12,000 inhabitants/km2) 4 km away from the new engineering hub in San Giovanni a Teduccio. Starting from these considerations, after showing the history of bike and bike sharing, the aim of this research is to evaluate the attitude to choose bike sharing for potential engineering students residing in Portici. For this reason, a mobility survey (RP and SP) was conducted at the high schools of the city of Portici. The results show that on average a student is willing to walk up to 900 meters to reach the bike sharing station. In the case that the bike sharing service is with pedal assistance charged of an annual cost of 30 euros, there is a higher attitude to choose bike sharing, but less attitude to walk to reach the station. Indee, in this case a student on average is willing to walk up to 600 meters to reach a bike sharing station. © 2021 IEEE},

The design process, like the ITC tool itself, must increase and combine the skills of groups as individuals, and improve their interactions with spaces. The final goal is to allow the dissemination of the tool within civil society with a constantly increasing demand and users awaiting solutions. GEVU (Global Evaluation and Visualization of Uses) is a multimodal assistive ICT device to empower people. It is the outcome of a new participatory method with end users. Everybody, especially people with sensory, cognitive, motor, balance and spatial impairments, can use the software. The specifications allow to: generate an «Accessibility Performance Audit» in a guided and simplified way according to the four major types of impairments (visual, motor, mental and auditory); map the accessibility levels and barriers; find technical solutions and evaluate the costs of the installations and prioritize the actions to be carried out in the short, medium and long term; generate accessibility reports in relation to legal and usage indices. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing dependence and expectations on online platforms to provide faster responses during all hours of the day, a web-based chatbot could be considered as the ideal solution to do so in the educational domain. A chatbot is a conversational agent capable of emulating human interactions. The purpose of this project is to implement a chatbot for a college website in order to make it more accessible, convenient and to enhance user experience. Campus navigation through Google Maps is an additional feature which is integrated into the chatbot to better assist the user. A menu containing frequently used links is provided which redirects the webpage according to the user's choice. Using Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning technologies, a chatbot EVA was created. Natural Language Processing is incorporated to allow the user to communicate with the chatbot using natural language input. A Sequential Model is developed using Neural Networks and the concept of Bag of Words is utilized. Tkinter is the tool used to set up the Graphical User Interface. A basic level performance test was conducted which revealed an efficiency rate of 89%. Finally, the chatbot was integrated with a college website which resulted in the generation of a functional college chatbot. EVA not only provides concise answers to the user's queries, but also necessary links to information regarding course content, extracurricular activities as well as directions to various locations on campus as per the user's requirement. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has seen significant growth in urban development over the past two decades. To overcome the implication of this development, Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has called for sustainable transport development at all levels, including the Light Rail Transit (LRT), which is a friendly mass transit system to satisfy the requirements of urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and green power efficiency. The shift towards sustainable mass transport systems has become the ideal choice to overcome the challenges accompanying the growth and development facing cities such as Dubai and to convert them into sustainable environmentally friendly places. Dubai is arising an extraordinary development of urban projects and strong attention targeting infrastructure and transportation systems. Therefore, the most sustainable transport system used to enhance the rabid development is the light railway system that plays a major role in shifting the city toward sustainability. Consequently, the Metro and Tramway systems are recognized as optimal provisions of public transport mode for high-capacity public transport systems in Dubai. This helps to improve the infrastructure by promoting connectivity, economy, and a sustainable environment. The paper investigates the impact of Dubai Metro in accelerating the Urban Development in Dubai. Urban transformation pattern around the main Metro Stations is studied. Population densities, connectivity, and land use pattern are examined. Three main Metro Stations have been selected for this study, namely: Jabal Ali, Al Barsha First, and Business Bay. To achieve this aim, the following objectives are covered: to investigate the needs of the sustainable transport system to cope with the urban development requirements; to examine the population density, connectivity, and accessibility around Metro Stations; and to analyze the impact of Dubai Metro on urban land use. The research methodology focuses mainly on qualitative analysis of the use of a light railway transport system. GIS and Spatial Maps, interviews, case study analysis, and land use investigations have been used to reach the finding of this research. The study indicates an overall positive impact of Dubai Metro on commercial and residential land uses on one hand, and connectivity and accessibility on the other hand. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Indoor Navigation Systems are constantly improved in a variety of technological fields, but often without considering individual user requirements. As a direct consequence, navigation information is not sufficient for the variety of all users. By combining and evaluating user requirements and data models for indoor representation, five categories of indoor navigation information were compiled. OpenStreetMap (OSM) serves as a basis to form items for an online survey for able-bodied, visually and motorically impaired people. Based on the results, we determined: User groups are an important element in indoor navigation. Individual preferences and time dependence of information need to be considered additionally. These results are then used to derive implications for several stages and components in the technological development process. We argue that following these implications by including user requirements in these processes will lead to a higher satisfaction with Indoor Navigation Systems for all users. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Academic Website is one of the internet-based information media used by educational institutions such as universities, institutes, schools, and other non-formal institutions. The general information contained in the academic website includes study programs, scholarly activities, academic achievements, study plans, academic calendars, and academic information systems. Webometrics is a system that provides an assessment of all the best universities in the world through the university's website. Webometric ranks more than 22,000 Universities around the world. There are three components that become the leading indicators of this Webometrics assessment, namely: visibility/impact, transparency/openness, and excellence. In addition, usability can be exploited to provide an evaluation of the website's quality. Usability refers to how easy it is to use the interface of a website. Usability can be measured by using five criteria, which are navigation, personalization, download speed, accessibility, and ease of use. This work investigates the impact of website usability on webometrics ranking. The sample of this research is 75 websites of regular universities in Indonesia. For data collection, several research instruments were used in the form of an online checker. The data was then analyzed by exploiting Structural Equation Modeling. The result shows the ranking of university websites based on usability criteria gives significant results similar to the ranking results with three standards released by Webometrics. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={A stable system of territorial development largely depends on the effective operation of the transport complex. The transport system ensures the satisfaction of transport demand, which makes it possible to serve various economic processes of the life of cities/regions/agglomerations. In turn, ensuring the proper level of mobility when moving passengers and cargo significantly affects the quality of life of the population. The task of the development of the transport complex is to increase the availability of movement, including in matters of meeting demand at the level of international travel. The availability of a public transport infrastructure is an important prerequisite for the possibility of moving people and goods be-tween the functional and spatial areas of the territorial agglomeration. The improvement of the passenger and cargo transportation system, the development of the transport system of the Northern regions is the most priority task. To solve this problem, it is necessary to form regional transport planning documents. Transport planning allows you to ensure the development of infrastructure, which contributes to increasing the efficiency of the transport complex. The article provides a brief overview of the aspects of transport planning and reflects the experience of developing transport planning documents on the example of the Sakha Republic. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Along with the growth of communication and satellite industry, the importance of satellite antenna evaluation is increasing. Particularly Communication On The Move (COTM) terminal antenna, including the communication between new types of constellations on LEO and MEO, requires tracking accuracy test for the communication on moving vehicles. The conventional test facilities are locally fixed and lack flexibility. To make the antenna measurement more accessible, we are developing a methodology for in-situ measurement by introducing multiple Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles (UAVs) system with RF payload. Thanks to the dynamic flexibility of UAVs, this system can flexibly change the test configuration on site and make new test scenarios available, such as emulating the orbit of non-GEO satellites during the measurement. However, one of the challenges of the proposed system is the additional uncertainties during the measurement due to the mobility of UAVs. To overcome this challenge, we design recursive stochastic filtering and fusion approaches, and evaluate their estimation performance via numerical simulations. By introducing stochastic filter and fusion algorithms, the effect of error is mitigated, and better accuracy can be achieved compared to an existing method. This project is performed in collaboration with Cranfield University in the UK and QuadSAT in Denmark. © 2021 AMTA.},

abstract={Public transportation is a cost effective means for reaching a destination while not exacerbating climate change by cutting down on CO2 emissions through displacing single or low occupancy vehicles. Unfortunately, public transportation is vastly underutilized in the United States and many efforts to reverse the bad precedence set by the automotive industry in the past decades have fallen short. The Public Transit Hub (PTHub) project under reserach and development at Santa Clara University's Ethical, Pragmatic, and Intelligent Computing (EPIC) laboratory aims to aid the resurgence of public transportation usage by creating an event and navigation mobile/web software that prioritizes public transportation utilization through 1) auto calculating, tabulation, and tracking of the amount of money saved and CO2 spared by using public transportation for the trip over a single occupancy vehicle; 2) gamification of saving money and sparing CO2 by utilizing the application for navigating the public transportation option of travel through periodic badges and awards; 3) an engaging new reverse search functionality allowing the exploration and discovery of attractions accessible directly from public transit stops, stations, and hubs without a last mile/kilometer burden in an effort to encourage public transportation utilization as a mode of discovery; and 4) detailing the scenery, monuments, and other attractions visible while on a specific public transportation route as a way of transforming the act of riding public transportation from just a means to an end, to an end in of itself. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={An increasing part of the population is living in cities urban areas and public transport is an essential part of people's live because it is cheap and convenient. Bus is an efficient medium of transportation to commute from one place to other because it is safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transportation system for all. Now, waiting for a bus to arrive without knowing real-time arrival and getting late due to bus unavailability or hard times due to overcrowding are the main reasons people don't take bus transport nowadays. In this very paper, we have discussed a solution for tracking and estimating the time of arrival of a city bus so that users can get to know the exact location of a bus as well as know the time of arrival at a particular station. We also have discussed a solution where the user gets to know about the various options of buses, one can choose on a particular route because we all know there are always a different number of buses running between two stations and most users don't know about all of the options of buses on a single route. A problem of overcrowding especially in these times of pandemic of corona and illegal tickets or some other ticket fraud is being tried to be solved by the way of digital tickets. By our solution, we aim to completely digitalize the main backbone of city public transport i.e., buses and to such extent, we try to introduce and implement seat booking in the intra-city buses. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The article presents a method developed by the authors to assess the accessibility of urban improvement facilities for low-mobility groups of the population based on the analysis of text data from social networks and the socio-psychological well-being of city residents. The object of the study was the profiles of landscaping objects in Google Maps located in the Petrogradsky district of St. Petersburg, 25 urban landscaping objects (parks, gardens, squares) were selected. During the study, the total number of comments for each improvement object was determined, reviews were analyzed, reviews were identified that describe the impressions and experiences of elderly and low-mobility groups, and the tonality of these messages was evaluated. The analysis of the reviews showed that the comments contain information from low-mobility groups of the population describing the problems of improvement facilities, in particular accessibility. The conclusion is made about the great potential that can be extracted from the use of automated data collection from geoinformation social systems. Findings show that overlapping data from Google Maps enriches the analysis that would previously have relied on a single source. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

abstract={According to past research applied in countries such as England, Germany and Mexico, the lack of accessibility for users who pass through pedestrian infrastructures is a recurring problem since goods, products and/or services, in many cases, are designed without thinking about the difficulties, disabilities or characteristics that the user may have. With this, it seeks to make a proposal where the objective is to prioritize the mobility of the user, providing a higher quality of service, being the urban spaces more comfortable and safe. To achieve this, the main deficiencies in the different areas within the pedestrian infrastructure were identified together with a survey of the level of satisfaction towards users. Then, with the information on the deficient areas, we proceed to make use of the SketchUp software, where the current scenario is modeled and thus observe the changes that are required to be proposed to achieve this objective. Then, universal accessibility principles will be applied such as relocation of urban furniture and use of spaces in order to benefit and facilitate the journey of all users. Finally, with the data collection of the pedestrian count and the calculation of the new areas for the mobility of pedestrians, it was possible to find the pedestrian space and pedestrian flow of the proposal, which shows a great benefit for the users who pass through the pedestrian infrastructure [1]. © 2021 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

abstract={In Europe, urban areas represent the "engine"of economic growth and employment in a territory: About 85% of the EU's GDP (gross domestic product) is generated in European cities. Several European cities, due to the extensive economic activities in urban areas, have to deal with and manage issues related to or caused by transport and mobility such as congestion, air pollution, safety and noise pollution. In 2010, for example, about 73% of European citizens lived in urban areas; this percentage is estimated to increase to more than 80% by 2050. In addition to the direct impact generated by traffic, urban mobility can also influence social development, social exclusion, and accessibility for people with reduced mobility. Consequently, the need to adopt sustainable transport systems is now a global goal that can no longer be postponed. To promote sustainable mobility models, current planning strategies have used smart growth interventions to move from mono-centric city structures to poly-centric, more localized configurations. For example, the idea of the 15-minute city is gradually growing in importance from both a policy and social perspective. The basis of the idea is the promotion of interventions to increase the supply of local services, such as schools, public transportation systems, health care facilities, dining facilities, jobs, recreation areas, and retail stores. In this way, local areas are created that are sustainable, inclusive, and walkable within a small radius on foot or by bicycle. Starting from these considerations, the aim of this work is to apply the idea of the city in 15 min to railway stations: In this perspective, the railway station becomes the starting point of the analysis as it represents the "door of the house", from where users start their last mile trips after getting off the train. For some railway stations located in northern Italy, an analytical index has been defined that summarizes the characteristics of the station in relation to the territory in which it is located. In this way, it is possible to classify the stations on the one hand and, on the other, to identify and propose improvements aimed at relaunching the role of a railway station in a territory. © 2021 WIT Press.},

abstract={The urban environment and the quality of the urban spaces are greatly affected by different forms of mobility, from the extremely impactful mass use of private vehicles to the 'soft' pedestrian walkways and cycle paths, and also through the several modes of public transport. In this paper we first explore the different urban impacts of these forms of mobility and the interaction between the urban system and the transportation system, and we then analyse the relationship of factors promoting urban quality in accordance with literature on urban design. Next, an analysis of the street's cross section is made, as the quality of this space is inextricably linked to its grade of sustainable mobility. The results of this study are contrasted with the experience within Granada's Metropolitan area, which has a high level of private vehicular use, for example its heavy congestion coupled with severe environmental pollution. A new light rail system (LRT) has been developed, with major urban renewal along its track. The LRT has the particularity of having varied cross sections, whereby the improvement in quality of urban space along them can be evaluated. The high-quality urban spaces are those with virtually no vehicular access whatsoever, providing a completely pedestrianized area, such as in the traditional urban road crossing axes in the outlying districts, which are now almost completely free from vehicles and are more greatly accessible to people. As a result of current social distancing required by the COVID-19 pandemic, urban space, which can be configured in a very adaptable way, is changing in many cities including Granada, giving more space in their streets to sustainable mobility modes and, therefore, indirectly increasing their quality and longevity. The changes carried out in Granada reveal a requirement for the promotion of improvement in urban spaces and sustainable mobility on a metropolitan scale, since the LRT is not enough if it is not accompanied by other urban development and mobility integrated measures. © 2021 WIT Press.},

abstract={Pushrim-activated power-assisted wheels (PAPAWs) are assistive technologies that provide on-demand propulsion assistance to wheelchair users. In this study, we aimed to develop an adaptive PAPAW controller that responds effectively to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., type of surface or terrain). Experiments were conducted to collect kinematics of wheelchair motion using a frame-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) while performing a variety of wheelchair activities on different indoor/outdoor terrains. Statistical characteristics of velocity and acceleration measurements were extracted and used to develop a terrain classification framework to identify certain indoor and outdoor terrains. The terrain classification framework, based on random forest classification algorithms and kinematic features, was implemented and tested in our laboratory-developed PAPAW. This computationally efficient terrain classification framework was successfully implemented and tested in real-time. The power-assist ratio of each wheel was adjusted based on the type of terrain (e.g., more assistance was provided on outdoor terrains). Our findings revealed that propulsion effort (e.g., peak input torque) on asphalt was significantly reduced when using adaptive controllers compared to conventional PAPAW controllers. In addition, subjective views of participants regarding the workload of wheelchair propulsion (e.g., physical/cognitive effort) supported the positive effects of adaptive PAPAW controllers. We believe that the adoption of terrain-specific adaptive controllers has the potential to improve the accessibility of outdoor terrains and to prevent or delay upper extremity joint degeneration or pain. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Urban transport sustainability is of prime importance for achieving desired urban outcomes which impact economic, social and accessibility dimensions. In many of the growing cities, everyday mobility is influenced by several factors which hinder sustainable and smart transport operations. This study is aimed at identifying the indicators to measure the sustainability of the transport systems, with special focus on urban mobility. A systematic literature review was conducted for this purpose, between 2000 and 2019, from databases including Scopus, Web of Science, KCI-Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, and SciELO Citation Index. An assessment of the economic, social, and accessibility indicators of sustainability on urban transport systems was carried out. This research work has allowed the identification of the main indicators of sustainability referred by different researchers in the field of urban transport systems. Based on the careful bibliographic analysis, a set of the identified indicators is proposed so that reviewed indicators can be utilized more objectively and accurately for smart urban mobility patterns. This review study can be helpful in assisting researchers who are exploring to evaluate sustainability perspectives in urban transport systems. © 2021 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

abstract={This case study research assesses the social impacts of inadequate transport facilities on the people of the city of Dhaka using the qualitative content analysis method. From livelihood to the urban communities’ mobility, all life-related matters are directly or indirectly related to public transport. However, the transport system in this city is one of the worst in the world. Hence, there is an absolute necessity to examine the inadequate transport facilities of the present transit system and their social effects on the people living in this city. Vanclay’s Social Impact Assessment was integrated to investigate the impact. In six specific gateways of Dhaka, in-depth interviews with 1800 respondents were carried out to know about the social impacts of insufficient public transport facilities. The social impacts of inadequate transport facilities create problematic conditions specifically for the low and middle-income communities of Dhaka, aggravating traffic danger, absence of protection and safety, social isolation, reduced mobilities, loss of social capital, cultural deprivation, absence of social interaction, family estrangement, travel cost, deficiency of transport accessibility. In the future, it will have serious repercussions for its residents. © 2021 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Demand responsive transit (DRT) can provide an alternative to private cars and complement existing public transport services. However, the successful implementation of DRT services remains a challenge as both researchers and policy makers can struggle to determine what sorts of places or cities are suitable for it. Research into car-dependent cities with poor transit accessibility is sparse. This study addresses this problem, investigating the potential of DRT service in Wayne County, U.S.A., whose dominant travel mode is private car. Using an agent-based approach, DRT is simulated as a new mobility option for this region, thereby providing insights into its impact on operational, user, and system-level performance indicators. DRT scenarios are tested for different fleet sizes, vehicle occupancy, and cost policies. The results show that a DRT service in Wayne County has a certain potential, especially to increase the mobility of lower-income individuals. However, introducing the service may slightly increase the overall vehicle kilometers traveled. Specific changes in service characteristics, like service area, pricing structure, or preemptive relocation of vehicles, might be needed to fully realize the potential of pooling riders in the proposed DRT service. The authors hope that this study serves as a starting point for understanding the impacts and potential benefits of DRT in Wayne County and similar low-density and car-dependent urban areas, as well as the service parameters needed for its successful implementation. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

abstract={This work is motivated by the high rate of private car use by commuters in Australian cities. Considering the various benefits of public transport (PT), it is imperative to analyze the shortcomings of the PT networks in comparison to car travel. For this purpose, this work focuses on analyzing the travel time difference between PT and car journeys. This paper presents a methodology to analyze the relative mobility of a PT network in comparison to car travel. The key component of this methodology is the use of two complementary relative mobility metrics that are developed to determine the portions of PT journeys that are inefficient (time-wise) in comparison to car trips. The first metric is the point-to-point relative mobility used to perform spatial distribution analysis, and the second is the PT line relative mobility that evaluates the performance of the PT routes. A demonstration of the methodology is presented by using a case study from Melbourne (Australia). The results of the case study show some inefficient segments of the PT services in several areas, and within the Port Melbourne area in particular. Therefore, this information can be used to assist decision makers to prioritize PT improvements to encourage mode shifts to PT. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

abstract={Although metro systems are established in many Asian cities including Chengdu, they have yet to cover every corner of a city. Understanding the transfer behavior of passengers can provide insight into achieving efficient and sustainable urban transport systems. Combining shared mobility programs with metro to improve the weaknesses of traditional feeder modes is viewed as the most promising line of business in sustainable transportation for the near future. Therefore, this study aims to comprehend the factors affecting the usage regularity of shared mobility by deepening the knowledge on endogenous and exogenous effects, and integrating two modes, namely bike-sharing and ridesourcing. Two systems are cross-compared, first in respect of their travel characteristics. Then, a binary logistic model is employed to capture the influences of trip characteristics and travel environment characteristics on their usage frequency. Researchers found that trip distance is significantly associated with users’ mode options, indicating that bike-sharing and ridesourcing mainly serve short-distance and long-distance transfer users, respectively, although some users may be confused which feeder mode to choose for the journeys of 2 km to 4 km. There were also meteorological and temporal influences, with the competition and complementation of multiple shared mobility feeder modes being likely to change under extreme weather conditions, during peak hours, or on weekends. Besides, metro-shared mobility users value the accessibility of two kinds of transport service, which is affected by the metro station and its surrounding built environment. This study and the proposed policy implications are helpful for embracing a sustainable mobility design from general optimum. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

abstract={This paper reports the development of a microsimulation model-building platform and the implementation, validation, and deployment of an integrated transportation and land use model using the platform. The modeling platform provides a new approach to microsimulation by providing modular algorithms with which models can be configured without additional coding, enabling the rapid development, testing, and deployment of models. The integrated transportation, land use, and energy (iTLE) model is an operational microsimulation model for Halifax, Canada, that combines long-term household decisions with short-term travel choices. The model’s longer-term decision simulator simulates life-stage transitions, residential mobility, and vehicle transactions. The residential mobility module uses a logsum measure of modal accessibility to capture how house-holds’ travel options influence their location decisions. The model was run from 2006 to 2036 on a business-as-usual scenario of land use and transportation. Validation performed after 10 years against census data indicates that the model produces a well-calibrated simulated population. The model predicts rising population density and greater household incomes in the urban core and a rise in vehicle ownership. The disaggregate nature, integration of land use and travel behavior, and life-course perspective of the modeling framework make it valuable as a decision-support tool for testing alternate scenarios against the baseline. The ease of development afforded by the modeling platform will facilitate future research on new mobility options, ensuring that the model can easily be adapted to anticipated transformational changes in the transportation system. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

abstract={The concept of a smart city comes with the need to support a data platform that can gather, process and export the data of millions of sensors, coming from different sources, with information in different formats, in a scalable approach for realtime and historical data visualization, processing, and actuation in the city. This paper proposes a Data Platform for the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab, to gather, process, visualize and actuate on mobility, environmental and network data. The architecture of the platform provides a real open platform that is accessible for third-parties to collect data and to experiment their own solutions, through a secure and open data platform at their disposal. The results with respect to the amount of data gathered and examples of data show how this platform can be used to develop new applications and use both real-time and historical data for future predictions and actuations in a smart city. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Large-scale changes are expected for urban mobility systems, triggered by digitalization and various other factors such as climate concerns or urbanization. For researchers and planners, it is therefore becoming increasingly important to understand the determinants of variability and stability of travel decisions. The motivation for the study is that, in transportation research and modeling frameworks, travel choices usually derive from individual traits and accessibility variables. What is underrepre-sented by such an approach is that decisions are also socially embedded. The authors postulate that mobility patterns are strongly interwoven with the way people configure their social networks. The paper introduces and discusses an empirical approach to investigate the social embeddedness of mobility decisions. The basic premise of the approach is that social network configurations provide an important setting for daily life in general and individual travel decisions in particular. Analysis is based on a three-phase interview study, conducted in Karlsruhe, Germany. The analytical approach reveals that a substantial part of travel is only loosely coupled to generalized costs of transport. Instead, the motivational degree linked to certain relationships largely influences willingness to travel and the relative stability of everyday life. Relationships that are internally satisfying or extremely familiar to people appear highly persistent. Furthermore, relationships that provide a certain degree of flexibility appear changeable, though not necessarily in all dimensions. Only a very small number of relationships appear both substitutable and changeable. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.},

abstract={BRT lite is the backbone of the public transport system in Semarang that potentially contributes to the city's resilient mobility. Although it has been a decade since the operation of BRT lite began, its performance has not led to a significant shift from the use of private vehicles to public transport. Therefore, this study aims to assess the performance of BRT lite service in supporting the concept of a resilient city. The assessment was performed by measuring city- and corridor-level performances using a scoring method against a set of standards of infrastructure and operational factors. At the city level, the performance only fulfilled 45.12% of the standard. At the corridor level, the best performance was shown by corridors I and IV, with 15% and 6%, respectively, over the average point percentage. BRT lite in Semarang has not yet been considered resilient as it still needs improvement on indicators that ensure accessibility, responsiveness to disruption, and inclusivity. © 2021 Silesian University of Technology.

abstract={Nowadays, sustainable transport strategies and plans that involve different modes and options of travel have been considered as the suitable tools for tackling urban traffic and transport problems in cities with high population densities. In Libya, the mobility and traffic conditions in the urban areas experience number of problems, due the rapid increase in urbanization and the lack of public transportation means, which have led to an increase in the number of automobiles ownership per household. Libyan transportation authority stated that the road traffic has crucial negative impact on society's health and safety, considered that a major cause of death and injury in large Libyan cities, particularly, in Tripoli and Benghazi. In these cities, the car-based transport mode is predominated and most commuters are dependent on private travel mode to move from home to work or other destinations. While reviewing successful cities experiences that implemented comprehensive sustainable transport plans proved having access to a variety of transport modes and options can help households and road-users to reduce transport costs, improve transport safety, reduce pollution and providing easy and safe access to work, services and opportunities. Furthermore, public transport, includes buses; metro, light rail; and other modes, is one essential aspect of the overall system. This paper ascertains the remaining situation of transport and mobility in Benghazi, which is the second city in Libya, and hosts several important companies and institutions. Also, it is an important economy center and the most populous center in the Cyrenaica region. This study develops a plan for sustainable transport strategies that can be applied in or around the urban area of Benghazi to reduce transport problems, and this plan could be used as an indicator for achieving healthy and high quality of life in Benghazi community. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={According to the analysis of the existing internationalization strategies, it is demonstrated that its main source is an international students’ mobility, which is based on ability, willingness, and common interest in cooperation of three following subjects: countries charged with the import of education; countries connected with its export; higher educational institution of the country, exporting education, which provides its educational services for the citizens of the country, charged with the import of education. The success of this process depends on a certain set of factor indicators in politics, economics, sociology, and technology peculiar to each of the three participants. The authors propose common to all the participant’s list of criteria, which evaluate indicators of the stated factors according to the unique scale: political (administrative) stability; degree of participants’ cooperation; legislation in the educational sphere, mutual amiability of the subjects; level of administrative barriers, peculiarities of the demographic situation; economic performance, demand for majors of training; logistic accessibility; the number of graduate students; language attraction of training programs; level of career-oriented activities; correspondence between the level of applicants’ acquirements and requirements of the country, which exports education; competition on the market of educational services; accessibility of distance educational technologies; development level and dynamics of innovations. The integral estimation of efficiency forecast for the work of exporting higher educational institutions, with the population of a particular country, charged with the import of education is carried out by the analysis of the formed multi-level hierarchical structure. The convolution of hierarchical elements on each level of the hierarchical structure is done using a generalized f-mean, proposed by Kolmogorov-Nagumo. There are given examples of implications of the proposed methodology for quantitative and comparative assessment of the potential of countries which export education, that allows international services of the university to determine the number of the most attractive countries in terms of organization of international students’ mobility and therefore the concentration of administrative and financial resources in the chosen direction, in order to make a decision on promotion reasonability of the university brand on the foreign market of educational services. The model can be easily changed and modified by adding relevant parameters for a given university and time that significantly affect international students’ mobility, or excluding ones, which have a low impact on it. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={As underlined by the European Commission in Green Infrastructure (GI) - Enhancing Europe’s Natural Capital (2013), in Europe, solutions based on green infrastructures are particularly used in urban areas to reduce pollution and health problems related to population growth, and to the settlement concentration of activities and residences. With this paper, the authors evaluate the link between the old sectoral model of infrastructure planning and a more functional one, based on the new green infrastructure paradigms used in different European cities. The main aim is to understand how these paradigms can improve the viability and the quality of life of the population in a coastal city with a particular frame on sustainability. To this end, starting from national and international examples, the authors outline typologies of integrated planning between urban planning and green infrastructures with particular reference to the relationship between historic city and waterfront in coastal cities. Subsequently, these typologies will be applied to the case study of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy) as a tool to mitigate the fragmentation and unsustainable use of the soil with a particular frame in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This allowed not only to study a model for the city of Cagliari for the regeneration of waterfront urban areas, but also for developing a system of green infrastructures capable of minimizing travel times within the city and of increasing the accessibility of slow mobility. This paper shows a first phase of research as part of the ongoing elaboration of the Municipal Urban Plan (MUP) of Cagliari. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This study proposes a GIS-based methodology to measure accessibility to urban services, from the elderly perspective to support urban planning processes. In the light of a significant demographic change, policymakers should promote age-friendly urban planning approaches in order to guarantee equal opportunities to access to services and activities. We developed a methodology to measure accessibility to healthcare provision services, which considers urban characteristics and mobility features, as well as behavioral traits of older adults. The method belongs to the family of 2SFCA (Two-Steps Floating Catchment Area), which evaluates accessibility as the combination of both supply and demand of urban services; thus, we introduce innovative elements to shape actual mobility opportunities for the elderly and their travel choices within three different timeslots. The methodology was applied to the city of Nice (France), to measure accessibility to proximity services managed by Healthcare Regional Agency (l’Agence Régionale de Santé – ARS) of Provence, Alpes and Côte d’Azur. The outputs allow to quantify elderly people accessibility to primary health services and the application to the French case study has shown that the methodology could be effective to identify critical issues to support urban planning process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Most of the municipalities of the Italian territory are located in areas of high hydrogeological risk, i.e. exposed to flooding and landslides. Consequently, part of the existing cultural heritage on the national territory is located in areas subject to flood risk, which compromises the accessibility, preservation and integrity of cultural heritage. As an example, we consider a single flood event that occurred in southern Italy on November 11th and 12th, 2019, which mainly affected the city of Matera and its surroundings. This episode appears to be significant for the violence of the phenomenon that led to considerable quantities of water flowing inside the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, causing damage to buildings, including historical ones. The event has been analysed using both meteorology and geomatic technologies, to have an overview on spatial and temporal evolution of the phenomenon. Global Navigation Satellite System Zenith Total Delay (GNSS-ZTD) data obtained by receivers located around the city of Matera, were compared with measurements from ground-based devices (i.e. weather stations), Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, and ERA5 reanalysis. To assess the extent of the flood and show the flooded areas, the images provided by the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) were used, isolating and analyzing the images captured before and after the event. Finally, through a digital terrain model, developed using Agisoft Metashape software from satellite images, the morphology of Matera was recreated to evidence the areas of accumulation of water. Once all the information was obtained, the data correlated showed an overall view of the event. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Tactile maps are feasible to increase the mobility of people with blindness and to achieve spatial information of unknown environments. Exploring tactile maps could be a hard task. Research on the design of tactile maps, especially the design and meaningfulness of tactile symbols, mostly addresses outdoor environments. The design of tactile indoor maps has been studied less frequently, although they differ significantly from outdoor environments. Therefore, in this paper, 58 tactile indoor maps have been investigated in terms of the design of the headline, additional map information, legend, walls and information presentation types used. In addition, the design of common objects for indoor environments, such as doors, entrances and exits, toilets, stairs and elevators, has been examined in more detail and commonly used symbols have been extracted. These findings form the basis for further user studies to gain insights into the effective design of indoor maps. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Deep learning has made great advances in the field of image processing, which allows automotive devices to be more widely used in humans’ daily lives than ever before. Nowadays, the mobile robot navigation system is among the hottest topics that researchers are trying to develop by adopting deep learning methods. In this paper, we present a system that allows the mobile robot to localize and navigate autonomously in the accessible areas of an indoor environment. The proposed system exploits the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model’s advantage to extract data feature maps for image classification and visual localization, which attempts to precisely determine the location region of the mobile robot focusing on the topological maps of the real environment. The system attempts to precisely determine the location region of the mobile robot by integrating the CNN model and topological map of the robot workspace. A dataset with small numbers of images is acquired from the MYNT EYE camera. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function to tackle the bounded generalization capability of the CNN model in small datasets. The proposed loss function not only considers the probability of the input data when it is allocated to its true class but also considers the probability of allocating the input data to other classes rather than its actual class. We investigate the capability of the proposed system by evaluating the empirical studies based on provided datasets. The results illustrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and generalization capability. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges around the world. Many studies have applied mobility data to explore spatiotemporal trends over time, investigate associations with other variables, and predict or simulate the spread of COVID-19. Our objective was to provide a comprehensive overview of human mobility open data to guide researchers and policymakers in conducting data-driven evaluations and decision-making for the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks. We summarized the mobility data usage in COVID-19 studies by reviewing recent publications on COVID-19 and human mobility from a data-oriented perspective. We identified three major sources of mobility data: public transit systems, mobile operators, and mobile phone applications. Four approaches have been commonly used to estimate human mobility: public transit-based flow, social activity patterns, index-based mobility data, and social media-derived mobility data. We compared mobility datasets’ characteristics by assessing data privacy, quality, space–time coverage, high-performance data storage and processing, and accessibility. We also present challenges and future directions of using mobility data. This review makes a pivotal contribution to understanding the use of and access to human mobility data in the COVID-19 pandemic and future disease outbreaks. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

abstract={Books are a medium for communicating information and in recent years have taken the electronic form called e-books. This shift has opened new opportunities for the visually impaired in overcoming their struggles with books in the traditional paper format. Yet, the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) claimed that many e-book applications do not meet needs of the visually impaired. Very few studies had investigated this subject matter hence paving the way for this current study to address the above research gap. As a result, equitable access to e-books for the visually impaired is still limited. Hence, there is now a necessity to design usable and accessible e-book interfaces for the visually impaired. To achieve this goal, it is important to identify the e-book requirements of the visually impaired into their e-book applications. An online survey was conducted involving seven visually impaired students at a local Malaysian university. The target participants’ ages are between 21 and 27 years old. The outcomes of this study identified ten requirements for accessible e-book applications for the visually impaired. Among these requirements are features that enable users to zoom, read aloud, and search for book contents. Besides that, screen reader strategy and text-to-speech are also mandatory. Other requirements include clear text and sound, ease of navigation, high contrast, and high brightness. These requirements will involve the field of Human-Computer Interaction design which is applied particularly in the development of usable and accessible mobile e-book applications for the visually impaired. © 2021, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

abstract={Sustainable mobility is a priority for transport systems in urban areas. Contemporary planning of transport systems assumes an increase in the role of public transport in everyday trips. To increase the share of trips using public transport, it is essential to improve the accessibility of public transport stops. The accessibility of such stops depends primarily on the distance between the trip origin and the stop. Many factors influence the distance that passengers are willing to travel. This paper discusses the relationship between the access time to the bus stop and travel time. To study such a relationship, various statistical methods may be applied. This paper presents the results of the analysis performed based on the data on trips made by inhabitants of Bielsko-Biała, gathered during the building of its transport model. © 2021 Scientific Journal of Silesian University of Technology.

abstract={Advancement of civilization has strengthened human beings to achieve mobility tremendously in the twenty-first century. Unfortunately, the sudden, severe anguish caused by outbreak of coronavirus has just locked and sealed them in their residences for long. It has brought an abrupt change to human life irrespective of age, caste, and sex throughout the world by unsettling their daily busy schedule. Therefore, it is very difficult to cope with the situation, as the existence of the human beings completely depends on the internet accessible devices such as the mobile phone and laptop. Consequently, the economy has declined, depression among human beings has increased, and finally, series of deaths. Therefore, it has become necessary to identify the causes, symptoms, and the spreading pattern of coronavirus to live our life normally. Therefore, it is mandatory to do data-driven analysis dynamically. So, data analytics and analysis can be applied and utilized to achieve these above-mentioned goals. The objective of this chapter is to present meticulous data analysis for understanding the spreading pattern of this virus worldwide. At the outset, healthcare is given the highest priority.

abstract={Urban planning plays a key role supporting the multigenerational development of cities. Accessibility is one of the main fields of action in multigenerational planning. The aim is to increase mobility, reduce congestion and traffic, develop and integrate policies on public, private and shared transport, and promote the pedestrian safety. This study analyzes the policies, tools and urban actions that may provide strategic guidelines for dealing with the changing demographic phenomenon, with particular reference to the city of Milan, where the Urban Plan of Sustainable Mobility (PUMS) and the Architectural Barrier Elimination Plan were approved. The PUMS develops a system vision of the mobility of the metropolitan area, proposing the achievement of environmental, social and economic sustainability objectives, through actions aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the mobility system and its integration with the urban structure and socio-economic development. The study further analyzes the transport supply and mobility demand of the elderly, with attention to three peripheral neighborhoods: Gallaratese, Gratosoglio and Niguarda Ca’ Granda. This paper presents some findings of a study on Milan’s senior population and their mobility related issues within their neighbourhoods. As discussed beforehand, the three peripheral focus areas present a somewhat similar situation considering the quality of the neighbour layout and level of public transportation offered, which is essential for mobility and accessibility, yet also other fundamental services mainly concerning the older generation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Accessibility, until now, has been a wide concept concerning different sectors mainly connected with the sciences of transport, economy, and urban geography. Among several definitions of accessibility, the most shared refer to the possibility that an individual has, to participate in one or a set of activities in a given place. In general, accessibility also refers to the characteristic of a service or of a resource to be easily enjoyed by a large number of users and this relies on the capacity of a city or a region to guarantee high levels of quality of life. Accessibility, thus, aims at improving the comfort of urban spaces for all users assuring the same opportunities for all. In this sense, accessibility also takes into account social aspects. Tourism, and activities linked to it, by definition, are based on at least two types of movement: a long-range movement to reach the destination from the point of origin: a close-range movement to carry out the tourist activity itself (visit, have fun, eat, reside). The issue of urban accessibility particularly relates to tourism activities if we consider that tourism requires several services which are not exclusively related to mobility. In these concerns, the study aims to define an accessibility index particularly referring to tourist services. The method pointed out in the theoretical part of the study has been tested on the metropolitan city of Naples (MCN). The results provide a potential source of information to support decision makers in pinpointing interventions to improve the accessibility of services at the metropolitan scale. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Sharing economy and shared mobility has become a widespread trend in urban areas worldwide. Due to lower population density, car sharing, and other shared mobility applications are generally not accessible in rural areas. This paper utilizes a Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) method to assess the criteria importance in siting problem of rural electric vehicle (EV) sharing systems. Nordic rural areas are used as a case study in this analysis, and we compare their feasibility to act as a pilot location for EV sharing. Seasonal residence, rural tourism and counterurbanization are common themes in Nordic rural areas and act as enablers for rural vehicle sharing. Based on our novel application of SMAA to this context, we found that Swedish rural areas would be most suitable for a rural EV sharing pilot. High tourism and low vehicle ownership were identified to be the most important criteria for this siting problem. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: The study aims to promote independent mobility for persons with visual impairment or legal blindness (VIB) by developing a Web-based wayfinding application using geographic information systems (GIS). While the literature mainly focuses on technical devices presenting results for wayfinding, a lack of integration of user needs is identified. The inclusive, participative developed application offers step-by-step directions for pre-trip planning through an accessible user interface. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a semi-automated approach to extract a pedestrian routing network data set based on open government data and field survey. User profiles calculate different routes using a weighting scheme for landmarks, orientation hints, infrastructure of crossings and sidewalks. The adoption of ArcGIS Web AppBuilder widgets allows access of the user interface additionally through keyboard-only navigation and therefore screen-reader capability. Findings: GIS offers a powerful tool to design network analysis for persons with VIB. The routing algorithm accesses different user profiles, returning individualized turn-by-turn directions. The complex set of attributes, including shorelines, landmarks and barriers, can be integrated by semi-automated processes. Practical implications: The paper illustrates the benefit of GIS applications for wayfinding of persons with VIB to raise self-determination and independence. Originality/value: A ubiquitous pedestrian sidewalk network for a medium-size city comprises a novelty, as research has mainly focused on small areas. The integration of shorelines next to a various number of hints, landmarks and potential barriers through semi-automated processes allows reproducibility and transferability of the model to other cities. © 2021, Susanne Zimmermann-Janschitz, Simon Landauer, Sebastian Drexel and Jana Obermeier.},

abstract={Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is a user-centered service that combines different mobility services offered to the users by means of different packages. The users fulfil their daily mobility needs using a subscription-based smartphone application, which gives them access to the services within their mobility budget. Various surveys on MaaS have been run in the last years to capture which transport mode can be more suitable within a package and the user's willingness to pay. Moreover, pilot projects have been employed to figure out potential MaaS users' characteristics and inclination. Results among stated preference scenarios differ due to the different characteristics of the demand and supply. Hence, there is not a general consensus around the potential of MaaS membership choice. This study embraces an agent-based modeling approach which allows to maximize the user's utility of performing activities and account for travel costs to simulate two scenarios. The first one considers carsharing systems and public transport as a basic MaaS package. We further employ an economic approach which assumes MaaS services costs to be perceived as fixed costs by the customers. We assume the same MaaS package to be accessible to the generated population of the city of Berlin. The second is a Pay-as-you-go (NoMaaS) scenario where users pay the service experiencing trip-based costs. Evaluating the differential of users' utility when comparing the two scenarios this study aims to explore the characteristics of the potential MaaS customers. The results indicate a higher propension to subscribe among public transport and two-way car-sharers, whereas MaaS seems to capture new free-floating customers. The potential users employ both carsharing services longer in their daily trip chain in the MaaS scenario, because the new mobility system allows users to do not consider marginal cost in their daily travel pattern. Outcomes also indicate that MaaS will not be a direct substitute to private car, and it's likely to extend rental time of car sharing systems. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Mobile networks are evaluated to assess and measure network performance, thereby, improving customer satisfaction and revenue generation. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of mobile networks, identified as Operator A, Operator B, Operator C, and Operator D, providing voice communication service(s) in the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria. A drive test method was used to obtain the key performance indicators (KPIs) for accessibility, retainability, mobility, and service integrity, in comparison with the NCC-defined target for each. The KPI results were aggregated to give the overall network performance for each network operator across the selected drive route – main campus and staff quarters. The Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) network performance in both locations is far behind the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) defined KPI target and below the customers’ satisfaction, while the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network performance in both locations is permissible. This paper recommends that network operators regularly monitor, optimize and improve on the services provided to subscribers as well as invest in network resources to meet customers’ satisfaction as well as increase revenue generation. © 2021, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

abstract={The chapter presents a data-driven approach based on the use of Geographic Information Systems and data analytics for assessing the level of accessibility for the women passengers of the railway network service managed by FGC—the Railway Agency in Catalunya (Spain). A series of geolocated open and proprietary datasets related to the land and sociodemographic and mobility characteristics of the Province of Barcelona and to the FGC’s railway network has been analyzed and merged with disaggregated social-media data collected from Twitter. This was aimed at maximizing the diversity of station samples that will be observed, in order to ensure that the observed cases are representative of the different situations and locations of any single station. The selected stations are currently under investigation through on-site observations about universal design indicators and survey questionnaires focused on women passengers’ needs and expectations. Within the objectives of the H2020 project DIAMOND, the final aim of the proposed research is to support the definition of guidelines and policies for the inclusion of women’s needs in the design of future urban transport services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Recent advances in computer science allowed people to explore new possibilities for the fruition of CH all around the world. The development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the field of territorial systems and the evolution of Virtual Reality (VR) solutions opened new scenarios for the valorization of cultural goods. At the same time, recent advances in digital photogrammetry and 3D interactive navigation models on WEB-based on WebGL technologies offered new opportunities of digital fruition of CH. Considering this panorama, the presented work shows how the integration of these technologies gives a precious added value to the virtual fruition of CH. In particular, it has been considered a cultural path in the La Loggia district, located into the historic centre of Palermo. This area is rich in monuments, many of them not accessible to the public, within the I-ACCESS European Project. The starting idea was to enlarge and diffuse, as much as possible, the accessibility to the knowledge of cultural goods in a virtual way, stimulating at the same time their real fruition. The developed solution implemented a GIS platform HTML 5 based and freely available online from desktop and mobile devices. In the virtual tour, everyone could navigate inside the cultural path, accompanied by touristic information, and come and visit the indoor environments of the main monuments. This work offers a new approach to accessibility and represents an example of how new technologies could support the diffusion of knowledge of CH. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The study reported by this article aimed to identify applications designed to use smart cities' infrastructures to support the mobility of impaired people. A systematic review was performed based on a search of the literature. A total of nine articles were identified by this systematic review. These articles aimed to help the collecting of accessibility data, to support the navigation of impaired people, to propose smart parking for impaired people and to present a smart semaphore. The number of identified articles is not very representative within the total of articles related to smart cities and the described applications present a low maturity level and lack of assessment results, since only two articles report trials involving real users. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={A developing nation like India is quickly adopting the technologies related to electric vehicles (EVs) and slowly eliminating the fossil fuel-based vehicles as a part of their plan to battle climate change and increasing pollution in cities. In April 2017, the Government of India (GoI) planned to have all EVs by 2030 in the market. The promotion under faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles (FAME) scheme is also followed. The electric charging infrastructure is an essential component of the electric mobility ecosystem. It is essential for EV charging station markets to match the pace of the EV adoption and its growth. EVs are limited by their range and speed. The availability of charging stations and its network on the road is the key to encouraging a shift from fossil fuel vehicles to EVs. Therefore, an everlasting difficulty faced by most EV manufacturers and customers is the accessibility of a plug point for charging. Definitely, there is a requirement to shift from the grid-based charging stations to stand-alone off-grid solutions for charging. The key to resolve this problem is the use of abundant renewable energy sources such as solar energy. This chapter presents a detailed review of EV charging systems and solar-based EV charging systems, infrastructure, methodology, and their implementation in India. Various challenges and social barriers to the adoption of EVs are also discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Navigation inside a closed area with no GPS-signal accessibility is a highly challenging task. In order to tackle this problem, recently the imaging-based methods have grabbed the attention of many researchers. These methods either extract the features (e.g. using SIFT, or SOSNet) and map the descriptive ones to the camera position and rotation information, or deploy an end-to-end system that directly estimates this information out of RGB images, similar to PoseNet. While the former methods suffer from heavy computational burden during the test process, the latter suffers from lack of accuracy and robustness against environmental changes and object movements. However, end-to-end systems are quite fast during the test and inference and are pretty qualified for real-world applications, even though their training phase could be longer than the former ones. In this paper, a novel multi-modal end-to-end system for large-scale indoor positioning has been proposed, namely APS (Alpha Positioning System), which integrates a Pix2Pix GAN network to reconstruct the point cloud pair of the input query image, with a deep CNN network in order to robustly estimate the position and rotation information of the camera. For this integration, the existing datasets have the shortcoming of paired RGB/point cloud images for indoor environments. Therefore, we created a new dataset to handle this situation. By implementing the proposed APS system, we could achieve a highly accurate camera positioning with a precision level of less than a centimeter. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={From the beginning of the 21st century the Russian education system is in the process of transformation. Higher education has undergone the greatest changes within the framework of Russia’s integration into the Bologna process. Nowadays, priority projects are being realized to increase the openness, accessibility and competitiveness of Russian higher education at the local and international levels. Nevertheless, there is a period of stagnation of modernization caused by the instability of progressive development and the progress of reforms. According to the authors’ opinion, this situation is caused by a significant lag in the level of educational activities of universities. The article analyzes the rating presence of Russian educational institutions, analyzes the introduction of modern trends that exist in the global educational space. The authors draw conclusions about the discrepancy between educational activities in Russian universities of modern educational standards, which do not have a synergistic effect that would allow universities to reach a new level in the realization of programs and competitiveness. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This article presents a study of public transportation and accessibility to public services in Maldonado, Uruguay. Accessibility is a crucial concept in nowadays smart cities, to guarantee a proper mobility, citizen participation in social, economic, and cultural activities, and an overall good quality of life. Several data sources are studied and processed to characterize the accessibility provided by the public transportation system of Maldonado to public services, specifically to education centers. A matrix of travel times by public transportation is computed and used to define a flexible accessibility indicator to reach destinations of interest. Finally, an interactive visualization tool is developed to graphically display the computed information. The accessibility indicator constitutes an input for the decision-making of the transportation authorities of the studied area, as well as it allows identifying potential inequity situations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The development of Information Society and Communications Technologies provide new opportunities to monitor and improve the accessibility of modern cities. The concepts of smart and ubiquitous cities make use of processing, sensorization and communications technologies to provide knowledge and intelligence to the city. Knowing this information as up to date as possible is a very helpful tool to improve the lives of citizens, since it allows us to locate accessibility barriers, which helps improve citizen mobility. In this context, this work carries out the task of comprehensively characterizing the information on accessibility available in cities. To do this, we will catalog the information sources that we have available so far from previous works of this research group. The final objective is to find the most suitable format for representing accessibility information, as well as to define what the data to be stored will be: points, routes and areas. For this, the most used systems will be analyzed: GPX, GML and GeoJSON and will be compared to obtain a conclusion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Over the years, precise positioning has been the ultimate goal for Satellite Navigation Systems. The American Global Navigation Satellite System deliver the position and time information intended for various sectors such as vehicle tracking, oil exploration, atmospheric studies, astronomical telescope pointing, airport and harbor security tracking etc. Corresponding technological competitors such as Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), European Union’s GALILEO, China’s BeiDou and Japanese Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) are few other versions of Satellite based Augmentation Systems. Nevertheless, stern security measures, geographical statistics and stimulation of diverse Electronic Gadgets at indoor/outdoor surroundings make it critical to acquire data about any vicinity with seamless accessibility, accuracy and integrity with satellite links. In this paper, positional accuracy has been tested with analysis of EGNOS, EDAS and simple GPS receiver models at Rome City, Italy. To support results, various real time experiments/tests has been performed with GPS Receiver SIRF Demo software. The test was conducted on-board a car by installing a laptop equipped with GPS Receiver plus supportive SBAS (EGNOS particularly) through three diverse bus routes of locality and outcomes of few tested samples inside the Rome City center are specified to check the availability of desired satellite signals. Subsequently, comparative analysis has been executed between the simple GPS data received and GPS + EGNOS data collected during daytime traffic. The strength of test signals reveals accuracy of EGNOS in open terrain area with less congestion. Furthermore, Asian and European Advanced GPS systems are compared in terms of performance as well as feasibility of authentic, accurate and swift satellite navigation systems. © 2021.

abstract={Sustainable mobility is the ability to meet society’s need to move freely, communicate, gain access, trade, and establish relationships without sacrificing other essential human or ecological values, today or in the future. Sustainable mobility includes both the transportation of goods and people. Sustainability, when applied to urban mobility, can be measured by various sets of indicators. This paper presents the application of the indicators produced by the Sustainable Mobility Project 2.0 (SMP 2.0) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in the city of Lamia, Greece. Accessibility for mobility-impaired groups, affordability of public transport for the poorest, fatalities’ reduction, access to mobility services, mobility space usage, comfort, and pleasure are some of the 16 indicators calculated and estimated in the frame of this work. The indicators were calculated by a) conducting a relevant public opinion survey on a sample of 380 citizens, b) performing spatial data analysis, and c) studying existing transport studies and data. The set of indicators is used to evaluate the current situation of the mobility system in the city of Lamia, Greece, and to identify priority measures, practices, and policies for their improvement. By using them, the Municipality and other local authorities can identify where the strengths and weaknesses lie in the urban mobility system and assess potential actions. If repeated over time, this application will reveal the improvement or the worsening of the local urban mobility system, as well as the measures with the most significant impact on the system as a whole. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={When we talk about Space, our interlocutors think about planets, stars, asteroids, astronauts and, sometimes satellites. But, only a small percentage is aware of what satellite technology can do and the relevance of satellite applications in our everyday life. From satellite communication, to navigation and to earth imagery, satellites data and technology are contributing in improving our daily life, or businesses or helping the management of our cities. Often, the end users come across an obstacle in communicating their needs to the service providers. On the other side, the service providers themselves are not fully aware how to communicate with the end-users. In some cases, this lack of communication makes difficult to meet the demand of space applications from the user side with the supply from the service providers. Eurisy, an association of space agencies established thirty years ago, works to put the end users at the core of the space value chain. In this last decades, Eurisy has been attentive and responsive to the changes of the space sector trying to picture how end users are becoming familiar with space technology. In particular, how the democratisation of space is turning space, especially satellite technology, into an enabler to guarantee the development of a sustainable living, accessible to everyone. Eurisy recently started a review of the case studies collected over the last ten years thanks to direct testimonials, event and conferences, publications and surveys. The user-centred approach adopted is innovative in the space sector and over the years proved to be effective in connecting users and service providers in different contexts. The paper aims at: 1- Identifying challenges and barriers that characterise the relations between service and/or information providers and end users. 2- Analysing the changes occurred in the relations between end users and service providers from 2007 to date in Europe. 3- Presenting the reasons that motivates the use of satellite data and technologies and which of these is the most used. 4- Presenting Eurisy's approach as an applicable model outside the European borders and the benefits deriving from connecting space and society. Furthermore, the paper will briefly present the ongoing activities as examples of the work put in place by the organisation and how the user-centred approach is applied. © 2020 IAA},

abstract={Bhubaneswar, being the first smart city of India has already witnessed the initial application of the smart mobility methods in its infrastructure by the transition of traditional transportation techniques to a sustainable and digitally enhanced system. The paper primarily includes an extensive study of important criteria such as the pedestrian facilities, safety, accessibility and aesthetic appearance [3]. The survey is based on the principles of H. Krambeck’s ‘Global Walkability index’ that was developed for the World Bank. The methodology gives information to several key parameters and identifies the core areas for improvement. The study aims to suggest the walkability values, principles of inclusive and smart mobility and a qualitative analysis of the Old Town Area of Bhuvaneshwar around Bindusagar Lake and other temple complexes including the Lingaraja Temple. With dense and unplanned neighbourhood development, congested roads ad-hock marketplaces, archaic storm water drainage and poor waste management in and around the historic structures, this part of the city remains untouched by recent infrastructure developments. This paper aims at providing sustainable solutions by proposing retrofitting measures to the existing infrastructure. A walkability audit followed up with recommendations has been made, incorporating the latest trends in sustainable infrastructure. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},
