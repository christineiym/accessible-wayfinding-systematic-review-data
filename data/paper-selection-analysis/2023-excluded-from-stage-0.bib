abstract={Cycling is an outdoor activity with massive health benefits, and an effective solution for sustainable urban transport. Despite these benefits and the recent rising popularity of cycling, most countries still have a negligible uptake. This uptake is especially low for women: there is a largely unexplained, persistent gender gap in cycling. To understand the determinants of this gender gap in cycling at scale, here we use massive, automatically-collected data from the tracking application Strava on outdoor cycling for 61 cities across the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy and the Benelux area. While Strava data is particularly well-suited to describe the behavior of regular cyclists and its generalizability to occasional cyclists requires further investigation, the size of these data and their characteristics represent an unprecedented opportunity for the literature on cycling. Leveraging the associated gender and usage information, we first quantify the emerging gender gap in recreational cycling at city-level. A comparison of cycling rates of women across cities within similar geographical areas—where the penetration of Strava is assumed to be comparable—unveils a broad range of gender gaps. On a macroscopic level, we link this heterogeneity to a variety of urban indicators and provide evidence for traditional hypotheses on the determinants of the gender-cycling-gap. We find a positive association between female cycling rate and urban road safety. On a microscopic level, we identify female preferences for street-specific features in the city of New York. Assuming that the determinants of the gender-cycling-gap are similar across regular and occasional cyclists, our study suggests that enhancing the quality of the dedicated cycling infrastructure may be a way to make urban environments more accessible for women, thereby making urban transport more sustainable for everyone. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Cars are dominating urban traffic in cities around the world, even though daily trips in many cities are often realized with active modes of transportation or public transport. Urban transport planning processes need to adapt to this reality and the necessity of climate change mitigation. Against this background, the research project “Mobility Reporting”, a joint undertaking of the district Pankow in Berlin and researchers from TU Berlin and TU Dresden, established a new, goal-driven, and participative planning process. The process identified local mobility as one of the central planning goals. The 15-min city (FMC) was thus adduced as a benchmark to analyze the district’s current mobility system and development potential. We conducted extensive accessibility analyses to examine the status quo concerning the FMC. We calculated travel times to essential destinations in daily life by foot, public transport, and car. This analysis was accompanied by a mixed online and paper–pencil survey conducted to evaluate the perceived accessibility of people in Pankow. The survey results shed light on the question of which walking time thresholds constitute a “very good” or “good” accessibility. Further analyses included environmental and social variables, allowing us to check whether areas with different accessibility levels also differ regarding the socio-economic characteristics of their inhabitants. For example, do socially advantaged neighborhoods have better local accessibility? Is there a trade-off between exposure to environmental pollution and good accessibility? With this contribution, we shed light on what an FMC is and ought to be. Results from the survey support the normative and political vision of the FMC. Pankow generally offers the merits of a walkable city, showing the expected travel time differences between the dense inner city and the outskirts. Socially disadvantaged neighborhoods are not consistently less accessible. However, there seems to be a trade-off between good accessibility (especially PT accessibility) and correlated externalities of transport, namely air pollution and noise. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Understanding occupancy patterns in buildings is crucial for energy system planning, energy model calibration, and occupant-centric operations for health and comfort. In this study, we detected and analyzed the occupancy patterns of university libraries, a building type that is largely overlooked in existing studies but can provide a unique opportunity to understand the human-building interactions given that occupants are free to choose their seats from hundreds of possible options in built environments. In libraries, occupants usually do not have fixed seats and pick seats within the built environment that they like, which provides a non-intrusive opportunity to carry out post-occupancy evaluations. We used the publicly available seat reservation data to analyze the occupancy patterns over one semester in four libraries, and proposed four metrics to capture important mobility parameters and behaviors at multiple spatial–temporal scales. We constructed two sets of databases consisting of around 70 million records of nearly 3,000 seats in 4 libraries, with seat-level resolution and sampling frequency of every 10 s. The informative data set depicts not only the overall spatial–temporal occupancy patterns, but also nuances associated with seats and visits. The daily flow of the main library exceeded two visits per seat. Half of the visitors stayed at the libraries for 3–6 h during a single occupancy. Semester schedules and campus accessibility together influence students’ decisions on when and to which library to go to, while even within the same zone, some seats were always more popular than their neighbors. We found that influential factors included privacy, distance to neighboring users, access to the outdoor environment (window), etc. besides the well-studied conventional Indoor Environment Quality factors whose importance might have been over-emphasized, and we summarize the balance of these attractive features as “semi-isolation”. This work provides fresh data for library occupancy modeling. Our findings can inform the design, operation and management of university libraries, emphasizing the importance of human-centric, sensory and biophilic designs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Subway systems are an example of how underground space can contribute to developing more sustainable cities. Their use can be encouraged by integrating other urban transportation modes to provide easy access to the stations, thus facilitating intermodal connectivity. However, few studies have addressed data and modeling issues with multiple modes. This gap, mainly due to the lack of appropriate methods, explains why relationships between traditional and emerging modes remain poorly understood; there is still debate about whether they are complementary or competitive. This paper investigates this question by examining interactions between three alternative modes (bikesharing, free-floating carsharing and taxi) and the Montreal (Quebec, Canada) subway over two months. To this end, several operational passive datasets are merged. A two-level growth model, including both fixed and random effects, is then developed based on time series of daily numbers of boardings at subway stations. This longitudinal model quantifies the effect of various variables (calendar, weather, socio-demographic and economic, network connectivity, land use and built environment attributes) on each station use. The correlations between subway boardings and alternative mode destinations are also measured to detect potential intermodal relations. Finally, a further categorical analysis is conducted by period and station type to specify these interactions in time and space. Results reveal that alternative modes tend to complement the subway in the network periphery (as possible access mode to the subway stations), but may compete with the subway in areas closer to the city center. Such findings could help policymakers determine the location of the mobility services to enhance first-mile subway access, as well as the best mode integration around subway stations in planning strategies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Attributed to the advances in sensing and visualization technologies, novel wayfinding assistive systems are becoming more accessible such as the augmented reality (AR)-based wayfinding guidance that provides immersive information about the space and environments. However, the excessive information provided by these new methods results in cognitive overload, leading to subpar performance. Especially for emergency wayfinding where responders need to process a large amount of information while performing search and hazard identification tasks, an overdesigned wayfinding user interface and excessive information can cause confusion or disorientation among responders. This study proposes and tests a real-time cognition-driven navigation assistive system for emergency wayfinding called CogDNA. CogDNA measures responders’ real-time cognitive load and mental status based on the high-frequent pupillometer and gazes tracking data. Then the elements and formats of the primary wayfinding information are adjusted based on the individualized cognitive load models and the mental fatigue status measured by the pupillometer data including gaze movement entropy and blink rate. To test the efficacy of CogDNA, a human-subject experiment (n = 31) was performed with local firefighters in a simulated emergency wayfinding task. Three conditions were presented including the control condition with a static wayfinding system, a self-adaption condition where responders could adjust information with gesture controls, and the auto-adaption condition that tailored information based on real-time cognitive load and mental status measures. The result shows that the proposed method reduces the workload and improves the performance of the responders during the wayfinding task. The self-reported assessments also indicate benefits of the proposed method in cognitive load.

abstract={Purpose: This research study aims at revealing a planning method for the development of the Souq Waqif-Transit village. Design/methodology/approach: Over the past decade, transit-oriented developments (TODs) have become an international city planning model for promoting sustainable urbanism. On a regional scale, the State of Qatar launched the construction of Doha Metro. The current network consists of three lines with a central interchange station within the city's most vibrant cultural core, i.e., between Msheireb Downtown Doha and Msheireb, near to the Souq Waqif historical site and Al Corniche waterfront promenade. The Qatar National Development Framework emphasizes the importance of stimulating sustainable urban growth by linking the Doha Metro with TODs. Findings: The findings show that the benefits of a strategy for monitoring and assessing the potential benefits of the investigated TOD linked to the analysis of the indices for (1) travel behavior, (2) built environment diversity and (3) other categories specific to the site's historical-heritage preservation. Research limitations/implications: Namely, a comprehensive approach for developing a historical site is/should be grounded in a planning method for enhancing the mixed-used urban fabric, public realm and walkability, and heritage preservation. Social implications: The insights from this research study aim to guide the long-term sustainable urban growth of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) cities in the future. Originality/value: The proposed sustainable growth planning scheme for the Souq Waqif addresses gaps highlighted through design tools of investigation. The missing attributes concern three key factors: (1) mixed-used urban fabric, (2) public realm and walkability and (3) built heritage preservation. The quality of streetscape, corridors, connections and connectivity of pedestrian and walkable network: TOD is not dependent on a singular mode of transport (Doha Metro), but it includes all systems that allow for mass public mobility within the city districts. Integrating other transport systems within mixed-use areas should be reevaluated based on accessibility to such systems, including taxi services, public bus services and public shuttles. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In recent decades, urban mobility has assumed a need for adaptation due to the more significant congestion experienced in cities and the growing focus on sustainability. Several solutions are proposed to help citizens move around in an urban environment. Most are not yet aware of the universal and accessible aspect that these solutions must have. This paper proposes a route support system embedded in a mobile application, Viana+Acessível, using a multi-objective approach. The application aims to promote accessible mobility within the city, contributing to physical and psychological well-being for citizens with reduced mobility, temporary or permanently, such as people with spectrum autism disorder, the visually impaired, wheelchair users, pregnant, and the elderly. For the evaluation of the algorithms, four objective measures were considered: accessibility, slope, time, and length of the paths. The tests carried out with different routing algorithms showed that the A-Star presented the fastest results in terms of execution time compared to the Dijkstra, Floyd–Warshall, and Bellman–Ford. When analysing in a multi-objective approach, time, slope and accessibility were demonstrated to be conflicting objectives. Bi-objective and tri-objective were applied and Pareto front was explored.

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted lifestyles and travel patterns, revealing existing societal and transportation gaps and introducing new challenges. In the context of an aging population, this study investigated how the travel behaviors of older adults (aged 60+) in New York City were affected by COVID-19, using an online survey and analyzing younger adult (aged 18–59) data for comparative analysis. The purpose of the study is to understand the pandemic's effects on older adults’ travel purpose and frequency, challenges faced during essential trips, and to identify potential policies to enhance their mobility during future crises. Descriptive analysis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to summarize the changes in employment status, trip purposes, transportation mode usage, and attitude regarding transportation systems before and during the outbreak and after the travel restrictions were lifted. A Natural Language Processing model, Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture, was adopted to open-ended questions due to its advantage in extracting information from short text. The findings show differences between older and younger adults in telework and increased essential-purpose trips (e.g., medical visits) for older adults. The pandemic increased older adults’ concern about health, safety, comfort, prices when choosing travel mode, leading to reduced transit use and walking, increased driving, and limited bike use. To reduce travel burdens and maintain older adults' employment, targeted programs improving digital skills (telework, telehealth, telemedicine) are recommended. Additionally, safe, affordable, and accessible transportation alternatives are necessary to ensure mobility and essential trips for older adults, along with facilitation of walkable communities. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={Community resilience provides a paradigm guiding communities' preparedness and mitigation efforts to counter the increasing risks of extreme events (EEs). Knowledge regarding how communities perform during and after EEs can inform proactive resilience enhancement practices. However, the EE impacts on impacted communities are influenced by multiple variables and their implicit interactions, which are difficult to be understood and modeled with conventional mathematical or statistical models. Thus, we calibrate a spatio-temporal deep learning model to capture the dynamics of impacted communities and use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to interpret the influence of communities' social and physical properties on EE impacts. Specifically, we couple graph convolutional neural network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the mobility dynamics for 666 census tracts (i.e., communities) in 14 medium-sized US cities affected by recent hurricanes. The model takes both static variables characterizing communities' preexisting conditions and dynamic variables depicting the changing hazard exposure. The interpretation of the model predictions based on DeepLIFT shows that community resilience, inferred from the perturbation of human mobility in this research, is highly event and geography dependent. Variables including walkability, green spaces, and civil participation generally contribute to fewer mobility perturbations, i.e., resilience contributive, while automobile-oriented accessibility and social vulnerability lead to more mobility perturbations when hazard conditions are controlled. This study empirically validates the mediative role of communities' social and physical properties on EE impacts and promotes more data-driven approaches for understanding and anticipating complex, dynamic, and place-specific community resilience. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The full use of underground space is recognized as a necessary means to improve the accessibility of residents and change the spatial distribution of urban population. The dividends generated by the metro operation will increase as the increases in the number of residents attracted to the zone. However, when the number of residents within the zone exceeds a certain threshold, travel accessibility may be reduced by exceeding the optimal service capacity of the metro, which leads to a decline in the per capita dividend. This paper uses the zone-based trip time reliability (TTR) to represent travel accessibility, and describes the interaction between the zone-based TTR and regional resident mobility. A generalized boosted method based Rubin causal model with longitudinal data was adopted to investigate the impacts of the improvement of zone-based TTR by metro operation on regional resident mobility. Then, an approximate BPR function was established to represent the feedback impact of regional resident mobility on zone-based TTR. Five typical areas considering population, average age, income level and land value are proposed to recognize the resident spatial re-segmentation rule. The results show that the metro operation has a significant impact on the regional resident mobility. And the improvement of zone-based TTR by metro operation is more attractive for resident relocation in Mixed and Stable areas than in Vibrant and Siphonic areas under the similar location distance. This paper intends to indicate the trade-off between zone-based trip time reliability (TTR) and regional resident mobility, and provide a reference for the development and utilization of urban underground space. © 2023},

abstract={Limited visibility into real-Time elevator statuses at transit stations in current web-based maps disenfranchises urban rail commuters who rely on functioning station elevators (e.g., wheelchair users). We shed light on the experiences of such commuters through interviews with representatives from five stakeholder groups (people with mobility disabilities, pregnant people, cyclists/stroller users/heavy-equipment carriers, disability advocates, and civic hackers). Motivated by our findings, we developed UnlockedMaps-an open-data map that visualizes the real-Time elevator status (accessible, experiencing at least one elevator outage, not-Accessible) of urban rail stations in six North American cities and displays nearby accessible restaurants and restrooms, assisting users in making informed decisions regarding their commute. We assessed UnlockedMaps by conducting (1) a user study, (2) controlled and "in-The-wild"longitudinal studies, and (3) follow-up interviews with our stakeholder groups. Our findings show that UnlockedMaps benefits all stakeholder groups, including those who do not rely on functioning elevators. © 2023 Owner/Author.},

abstract={COVID-19 has radically transformed urban travel behavior throughout the world. Agencies have had to provide adequate service while navigating a rapidly changing environment with reduced revenue. As COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted, transit agencies are concerned about their ability to adapt to changes in ridership behavior and public transit usage. To aid their becoming more adaptive to sudden or persistent shifts in ridership, we addressed three questions: To what degree has COVID-19 affected fixed-line public transit ridership and what is the relationship between reduced demand and-vehicle trips? How has COVID-19 changed ridership patterns and are they expected to persist after restrictions are lifted? Are there disparities in ridership changes across socioeconomic groups and mobility-impaired riders? Focusing on Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, ridership demand and vehicle trips were compared with anonymized mobile location data to study the relationship between mobility patterns and transit usage. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and changes in transit ridership, and an analysis of changes in paratransit demand before and during COVID-19. Ridership initially dropped by 66% and 65% over the first month of the pandemic for Nashville and Chattanooga, respectively. Cellular mobility patterns in Chattanooga indicated that foot traffic recovered to a greater degree than transit ridership between mid-April and the last week in June, 2020. Education-level had a statistically significant impact on changes in fixed-line bus transit, and the distribution of changes in demand for paratransit services were similar to those of fixed-line bus transit. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

abstract={Transportation systems globally face challenges related to congestion, decreased quality of life, limited accessibility, increased harmful emissions and costs, growing use of private cars and in some cases lack of intra and intermodal integration. Smart Mobility is believed to be a solution to some of these challenges by providing comprehensive and intelligent mobility services, decreasing transportation costs, promoting safety, and combating pollution and traffic congestion. Despite this potential, there is still uncertainty surrounding what smart mobility is and whether it is moving toward improving the quality of life and making cities more sustainable. To address this gap, this paper conducts a bibliometric review of 3223 Web of Science Core Collection-indexed documents to provide a comprehensive understanding of smart mobility research. The findings reveal a lack of multi-disciplinary approaches in previous studies with a strong emphasis on technological aspects and limited social or economic considerations in current research. The review identifies four distinct periods of smart mobility research, with recent interest sparked by advancements in big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and real-time technologies in transport systems. However, there is a dearth of research on smart mobility in developing countries, where urban populations are rapidly increasing. Thus, the review proposes a research agenda to address the current gaps in knowledge. Furthermore, the review provides an updated and integrated definition of smart mobility as the use of advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence, to improve transportation efficiency, mobility for all, and sustainability while safeguarding the quality of life. The primary challenge for smart mobility is the co-evolution with existing transport systems, making further research on integration with these systems and real-time technologies essential for advancing smart mobility research. The paper’s main contribution is an integrated conceptualisation of smart mobility research and novel research topics that build on this unified base. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Evaluation of the quality of service (QoS) of public city buses is generally performed using surveys that assess attributes such as accessibility, availability, comfort, convenience, reliabilities, safety, security, etc. Each survey attribute is assessed from the subjective viewpoint of the service users. This is reliable and straightforward because the consumer is the one who accesses the bus service. However, in addition to summarizing personal feedback from humans, using data analytics has become another useful method for assessing the QoS of bus transportation. This work aims to use global positioning system (GPS) data to measure the reliability, accessibility, and availability of bus transportation services. There are three QoS scoring functions for tracking complete trips, on-path driving, and on-schedule operation. In the analytical process, GPS coordinates rounding is adopted and applied for detecting trips on each route path. After assessing the three QoS scores, it has been found that most bus routes have good operations with high scores, while some bus routes show room for improvement. Future work could use our data to create recommendations for policy makers in terms of how to improve a city’s smart mobility. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Autonomous Mobility-On-Demand (AMoD) provides new options for the morning commute problem. The flexibility of AMoD could help to boost the attractiveness and accessibility of Public Transportation (PT). Intermodal AMoD systems could become a competitive alternative to personal cars. However, considering the convenience, comfort, and expected low fares of autonomous vehicles, there is a risk of competition between privately operated AMoD and PT. The joint design of PT and AMoD can foster their cooperation. This study investigates the joint PT-AMoD design problem in a many-to-one multimodal corridor where three transportation alternatives are available: full personal car on a congested freeway, walking and massive rapid transit (MRT), or autonomous vehicle (AV) and MRT. We introduce a simple dynamic model incorporating a time-dependent mode and route choice subject to user equilibrium (UE) constraints. The model presented: (i) accounts for how UE settles and evolves, (ii) provides insight on PT-AMoD cooperation opportunities and competition risks depending on the design choices, (iii) is compatible with design optimization heuristics. We apply the model to a realistic scenario based in the city of Lyon (France). The number of MRT stations, their locations, the number of AV fleets, and their coverage zone boundaries are optimized with a metaheuristic. The optimization is conducted according to three policies regarding AMoD (protectionism, opportunism, liberalism) and three priority objectives (maximize MRT usage, minimize travel times, reduce car usage). We formulate recommendations for the transportation authority by evaluating the potential benefits of each policy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Social scientists increasingly share data so others can evaluate, replicate, and extend their research. To understand the process of data discovery as a precursor to data use, we study prospective users' interactions with archived data. We gathered data for 98,000 user sessions initiated at a large social science data archive, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Our data reflect four years (2012-16) of users' interactions with archival resources, including a data catalog, study-level metadata, variables, and publications that cite nearly 10,000 datasets. We constructed a network of user interactions linking website landing (e.g., site entrances) to exit pages, from which we identified three types of paths that users take through the research data archive: direct, orienting, and scenic. We also interpreted points of failure (e.g., drop-offs) and recurring behaviors (e.g., sensemaking) that support or impede data discovery along search paths. We articulate strategies that users adopt as they navigate data search and suggest ways to enhance the accessibility of data, metadata, and the systems that organize each. © 2023 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Mobility measures have an influential impact on urban social sustainability. This has not been investigated enough in the recent urban waterfront redevelopment projects in United Arab Emirates (UAE). This research aims at first initiating an assessment method for the mobility measures on both the morphological/urban form and urban design levels. Then, it aims at applying this assessment method on Mina Zayed (Zayed Port) waterfront urban regeneration project in Abu Dhabi, as a selected case study. The assessment method relied on an established theoretical framework that defined the principles and indicators of both the mobility morphological measures including Compactness and Density, Mixed-Use Development, Accessibility, and Mobility Networks Connectivity and Integration on the one hand, and the urban design mobility measures including Comfort and Livability, Environmental Quality, Safety and Security on the other hand. The utilized qualitative/quantitative tools of the adopted Case Study method encompassed the expert analysis of the CAD design drawings, Space Syntax Theory application through the DepthmapX simulation variables of Step Depth, Choice and Integration. The initiated assessment method managed to reveal the challenges and potentials of the investigated mobility measures in the analyzed case study. Based on these outcomes, a set of enhancement strategies for mobility measures on both morphological scale and urban design scale has been recommended. These included, among other measures, improving the infrastructure for non-motorized modes of mobility, enhancing mixed land-use of the design, having a more integrated mobility grid and improving accessibility. The research findings proved the validity of the applied assessment method, with its relevant investigation tools, makes it a legitimate revising method for the waterfront urban regeneration designs in the UAE, and in other countries in the region to help significantly enhance the attainment of social sustainability in waterfront urban regeneration projects. © 2023 WITPress.

abstract={Accessibility is widely considered as the most crucial benefit of any transportation system. Low accessibility may cause compromise on living conditions, low economic growth, high unemployment, social seclusion, and long-term social inequalities. In developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, surveys fail to keep up with the pace of rapid urbanization. Additionally, numerous location-based data sets, including mobile phone location data and Google Maps travel time, enable near-real-time observations of actively changing mobility dynamics. In this study, we use these novel data sets to assess various facets of accessibility and corresponding poverty-based inequalities within the Greater Maputo region in Mozambique. A data-based approach is seldom used in the Sub-Saharan African context. Consistent poverty-based inequalities in access to opportunities by driving, transit, and walking are observed. The transit system was ascertained to be more inefficient in the poorer regions. The richer regions witnessed most decreased access to opportunities because of high congestion. People living in the poorest regions were observed to travel much longer distances to access facilities than did those living in the richest regions. These differences were particularly significant for essential services of education, healthcare, and employment. These results can help urban planners and policymakers identify disadvantaged communities and develop policies to ameliorate the conditions. This assists in measuring the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and investigating areas of concern. Moreover, this study shows the applicability of various data sets and methods in a data-deprived scenario in Africa, and motivates more scholars and practitioners to partake in this technology leapfrogging. © National Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={In smart cities, target detection is one of the major issues in order to avoid traffic congestion. It is also one of the key topics for military, traffic, civilian, sports, and numerous other applications. In daily life, target detection is one of the challenging and serious tasks in traffic congestion due to various factors such as background motion, small recipient size, unclear object characteristics, and drastic occlusion. For target examination, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an engaging solution due to their mobility, low cost, wide field of view, accessibility of trained manipulators, a low threat to people’s lives, and ease to use. Because of these benefits along with good tracking effectiveness and resolution, UAVs have received much attention in transportation technology for tracking and analyzing targets. However, objects in UAV images are usually small, so after a neural estimation, a large quantity of detailed knowledge about the objects may be missed, which results in a deficient performance of actual recognition models. To tackle these issues, many deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed. In this review paper, we study an end-to-end target detection paradigm based on different DL approaches, which includes one-stage and two-stage detectors from UAV images to observe the target in traffic congestion under complex circumstances. Moreover, we also analyze the evaluation work to enhance the accuracy, reduce the computational cost, and optimize the design. Furthermore, we also provided the comparison and differences of various technologies for target detection followed by future research trends. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The main objective of this research is to evaluate how the transport sector affects the satisfaction of citizens. The model developed aims both at assessing the satisfaction of citizens and using it as a tool to measure the change in citizens’ satisfaction resulting from new mobility practices or policies. The developed scenarios are based on the principles of sustainability and the action plans concern: better accessibility conditions for alternative means of transport; improving travel safety; reducing air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption; increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the movement of people and goods; and enhancing the attractiveness and quality of the urban environment. The results reveal that it is necessary for local decision makers to take further measures to increase the overall satisfaction of citizens with the aim of prosperity and happiness of citizens within their city, and the proposed model can support the decision-making process.

abstract={Independent wayfinding is a major challenge for blind and visually impaired (BVI) travelers. Although GPS-based localization approaches enable the use of navigation smartphone apps that provide accessible turn-by-turn directions in outdoor settings, such approaches are ineffective in indoor and other GPS-deprived settings. We build on our previous work on a localization algorithm based on computer vision and inertial sensing; the algorithm is lightweight in that it requires only a 2D floor plan of the environment, annotated with the locations of visual landmarks and points of interest, instead of a detailed 3D model (used in many computer vision localization algorithms), and requires no new physical infrastructure (such as Bluetooth beacons). The algorithm can serve as the foundation for a wayfinding app that runs on a smartphone; crucially, the approach is fully accessible because it does not require the user to aim the camera at specific visual targets, which would be problematic for BVI users who may not be able to see these targets. In this work, we improve upon the existing algorithm so as to incorporate recognition of multiple classes of visual landmarks to facilitate effective localization, and demonstrate empirically how localization performance improves as the number of these classes increases, showing the time to correct localization can be decreased by 51–59%. The source code for our algorithm and associated data used for our analyses have been made available in a free repository. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Shared-e-scooters are being introduced in cities worldwide, with their introduction often being distant from the actual service characteristics understanding, potential benefits, and threats realization. This research explores scooter use by examining approximately nine million scooter trips from five North American cities (Austin; TX, Calgary; AB, Chicago; IL, Louisville; KY, Minneapolis; MN). By investigating the spatiotemporal hourly and daily use, we found that demand patterns tend to be similar in the different cities. Trip characteristics (speed, duration, and distance) are almost empirically consistent across the five cities; however, there is evidence that trip characteristics change over time in the same city. We also examined the impact of exogenous factors on scooter demand, and found that weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and snow), day of the week, infrastructure (bike lanes, sidewalks, and shared bike stations), sociodemographics (gender, age, and income), land use, and accessibility to transit significantly impact demand. Findings highlight the need for evidence-based examination of shared-e-scooters and regulatory processes to guide policy decisions by the different stakeholders. © 2023 The Author(s)},

abstract={Urban environments, university campuses, and public and private buildings often present architectural barriers that prevent people with disabilities and special needs to move freely and independently. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the scientific literature proposing devices, and software applications aimed at fostering accessible wayfinding and navigation in indoor and outdoor environments. We selected 111 out of 806 papers published in the period 2009–2020, and we analyzed them according to different dimensions: at first, we surveyed which solutions have been proposed to address the considered problem; then, we analyzed the selected papers according to five dimensions: context of use, target users, hardware/software technologies, type of data sources, and user role in system design and evaluation. Our findings highlight trends and gaps related to these dimensions. The paper finally presents a reflection on challenges and open issues that must be taken into consideration for the design of future accessible places and of related technologies and applications aimed at facilitating wayfinding and navigation. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The growth of shared mobility has recently challenged the way mobility has traditionally been conceived. In this perspective, this study investigates the Environmental Life Cycle Costs of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) services to evaluate their potential integration with other transport systems, in the three-time horizons (2025, 2030, 2035). The key area of research was focused on the determination of the cost components of UAM required to calculate the unit costs of UAM transportation. To this end, unitary data and the method from a 2017 EC DG MOVE's report on urban accessibility have been adopted. The analysis confirms that most of the cost is related to the aircraft energy consumption during flight, while the rest is used by ground infrastructure. Moreover, the energy cost is strongly correlated with the distance travelled and the size of the aircraft. The longer the flight and the bigger the aircraft, the higher is the energy cost. Complex cost analysis should be able to support decision-makers in the definition of Sustainable Urban Mobility and their principles of integration, participation, monitoring and evaluation. However, it will be necessary to be able to draw on more consolidated and widespread data over time for the creation of Urban plans for Sustainable Mobility. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In general, poor road conditions, specifically road cracks constitute a public nuisance, causing troublesome to road users, severe damage to vehicles and accidents. Hence, it is essential to detect the road crack earlier as an early-stage preventive for maintenance, but traditional inspection method used in Malaysia to physically collect the road information is extremely time-consuming, hazardous and labour-intensive. Nowadays, new technologies have improved the measuring performance. This leaves a gap in comparing two modern technologies in road cracks mapping. This study aims to explore the quality assessment between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) methods in road cracks mapping. Two study areas inside the campus of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor, were selected. The ground control points (GCPs) and check points (CPs) at the study areas were georeferenced by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data with MyRTKNet and ISKnet connections. Low altitude aerial imageries were collected using DJI Phantom 4 UAV, while Topcon GLS-2000 was employed to acquire the dense data of the cracked road. GNSS and manual inspection methods were performed to evaluate the results. In terms of mapping and measurement, both TLS and UAV methods produce almost similar results with average RMSE differences ranging from ±0.003 m to ±0.030 m and ±0.042 m to ±0.224 m respectively. This revealed that TLS is more accurate than UAV in mapping and measuring work. Differences in DTM quality across these approaches is below two (2) cm. Based on this study, TLS is more reliable than UAV. However, UAV offers advantages based on several considerations such as cost, time, safety, and accessibility. In summary, findings from this study shed some light to the authorities on the feasibility of UAV and TLS methods in road cracks mapping. Copyright © 2023 T. Jia Yi.},

abstract={In the near future, the growth of personal mobility is expected to continue all over the world and to cause impacts such as increased levels of traffic congestion and worsened quality of life, mainly in highly populated urban areas. Alternative solutions for individual mobility have been promoted to dissuade people from using private cars. Particularly, renting private vehicles scarcely used by their owners would result in several benefits, including environmental ones, and traffic reduction. This type of solution, based on the willingness of individuals to rent their own vehicles, is called Peer-to-Peer Car-Sharing (P2P-CS). This study proposes a methodological approach focused on the adoption of both a reputation system and blockchain technology to support P2P-CS activities. Reputation scores are introduced to meet CS actors’ expectations of dealing with trusted partners, by allowing both access to service and the opportunity to customize CS fares, while the blockchain makes reputation scores publicly accessible and unchangeable and allows the P2P-CS transport solution to be managed without third parties. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified by several tests carried out on real and simulated data. The obtained results are satisfactory and encourage the adoption of these further sustainable travel mode opportunities. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={In this research, expert opinions on universal mobility in the footpaths of urban India have been critically appraised. Universal mobility (as a component of universal design) is still a largely ignored urban parameter in India despite an increase of 732.20% in the specially-abled and 105.25% in the elderly between 1911 and 2011. A total of 257 experts from the field of architecture and planning hailing from 66 cities in India were interviewed for this research. It was found that despite nationally implemented universal design guidelines, footpaths in 42.8% of the cities do not have universal mobility. In total, 74.7% of the respondents identify the dimension of the footpath as the most important factor for implementing universal mobility. The results of this study indicate the importance of universal design in improving the quality of life in Indian cities, and how urban local bodies can play a significant role in the process by using Public Private Partnership (hereafter, PPP) models and a new accessibility audit checklist. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The lack of indoor floor plans is one of the major obstacles to ubiquitous indoor location-based services. Dedicated mobile robots with high-precision sensors can measure and produce accurate indoor maps, but the deployment remains low for the public. Computer vision techniques are adopted by some existing smartphone-based methods to build the 3D point cloud, which have the cost of a quantity of the efforts of image collection and the risk of privacy issues. In this paper, we propose BatMapper-Plus which adopt acoustic ranging and inertial tracking to construct precise and complete indoor floor plans on smartphones. It emits acoustic signals to measure the distance from the smartphone to a neighbouring wall segment, and produces accessible areas by surrounding the building during walking. It also refines the constructed indoor floor plan to eliminate scattered segments, and identifies connection areas, including stairs and elevators among different floors. In addition, we propose an LSTM-based dead-reckoning model which is trained by outdoor IMU readings and GPS records, and use it to infer the step length during indoor walking, thereby improving the floor plan quality. We also elaborate how to use the constructed map for indoor navigation, i.e., a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm which automatically matches current inertial readings and historical sensory data during map construction to produce fine-grained walking guidance. To show our effectiveness compared with the state-of-the-art, we carry out extensive experiments in a teaching building and a residential building. It proves that our method is efficient without any privacy concerns and texture/illumination limitations. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Higher education institutions and organizations have new opportunities thanks to digital technologies. Universities worldwide seek to provide the most outstanding available student services, particularly those that promote student achievements in their program objectives. The World Wide Web, in particular, has advanced Internet-based information technology, dramatically impacting all types of education delivery. Therefore, it has rapidly expanded the Open and Distance Education (ODE) system. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the higher institutions’ ODE websites within 5 main criteria (Navigation, Accessibility, Design, Content Readability, and Announcements) and 20 sub-criteria. The case study has taken place in Türkiye, and the institutions available for the study were Anadolu University ODE; Ankara University ODE; Ataturk University ODE; Istanbul University ODE. This paper utilized two Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques: Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) and Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (Fuzzy WASPAS). The criteria were determined with the help of the literature, which was searched, then categorized and weighted with Fuzzy AHP. The evaluation step in the process was conducted with Fuzzy WASPAS to select the best-performed alternative ODE websites. According to research findings, Design is the essential criterion, followed by Accessibility, Content Readability, Announcement, and Navigation criteria. Our research identified and recommended the development areas for further research and proposed theoretical and practical implications as well as managerial decisions to be considered for the ODE website improvements. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Workplace location has a significant impact on daily mobility behavior, such as mode of transportation choice, as well as long-term decisions such as car ownership and residential location choice. Therefore, understanding accessibility to workplaces is crucial for promoting sustainable mobility. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive, open-source methodologies for multimodal and intermodal accessibility modeling for workplace locations. In this study, we present a modeling concept based on open-source tools such as OpenTripPlanner, PostGIS, and R, which allows for efficient and fast accessibility analysis of workplace locations at a regional level. Using the Munich Metropolitan Region as a case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of our model in conducting large-scale, multimodal, and intermodal accessibility analysis on consumer hardware. The maps produced by our model provide both absolute and relative indicators of accessibility, such as public transportation versus car accessibility, as well as a score. The results show that Munich and other centers have high competitiveness for non-car modes and intermodal combinations, but smaller cities also have potential for workplace locations that are not reliant on car access, with a large number of potential workers able to reach these locations within 30 min without driving. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Micromobility services hold substantial potential in terms of promoting shared and electric-powered mobility modes, however, little is known about their accessibility and what shapes their spatial coverage. These two issues are important to understand how socially equitable these modes can really be and how public policies should manage their implementation in urban areas. Hence, this study examines the determinants of the spatial coverage of four moped-style scooter sharing services (MSS) in Barcelona. The article examines the socio-territorial characteristics of the coverage areas of each MSS, as defined in 2019, together with the minimum area that operators had to provide service in 2020 according to the local regulation. For each MSS, a binomial generalized linear mixed model is employed to predict the odds of each cadastral parcel being covered by the service and analyzed the main spatial determinants associated with it. The results suggest that territorial coverage is defined by centrality, household disposable income, and topography, with low-accessibility areas consistently omitted from services. The conclusions underline the need for the public sector to participate in the design of spatial coverage areas of MSS to guarantee spatial equity and transportation justice and avoid private sector designs that systematically exclude less attractive areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={As radio frequency (RF) hardware continues to improve, many technologies that were traditionally impractical have suddenly become viable alternatives to legacy systems. Two-way ranging (TWR) is often considered a poor positioning solution for airborne and other vehicular navigation systems due to its low precision, poor angular resolution, and precise timing requirements. With the advent of modern RF hardware and advanced processing techniques, however, modern studies have experimentally demonstrated TWR systems with an unprecedented, sub-centimeter ranging precision with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) consumer-grade hardware. This technique enables a new class of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities for urban and commercial aircraft but also instigates new system design challenges such as antenna placement, installation of new electronics, and design of supporting infrastructure. To inform these aircraft design decisions, we derive 2D and 3D Cramér–Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on position and orientation estimation in a multi-antenna TWR system. We specifically formulate these bounds as a function of the number of antennas, platform geometry, and geometric dilution of precision (GDoP) to inform aircraft design decisions under different mission requirements. We simulate the performance of several classic position and orientation estimators in this context to validate these bounds and to graphically depict the expected performance with respect to these design considerations. To improve the accessibility of these highly theoretical results, we also present a simplified discussion of how these bounds may be applied to common airborne applications and suggest best practices for using them to inform aircraft design decisions. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={This research paper presents a novel approach for cost-benefit analysis for the bi-directional functionality of eVTOL (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft charging. eVTOL aircrafts represents an emerging aviation market that seeks to revolutionize mobility, both intra-city and inter-city, through an air transportation system for passengers based on safety, efficiency and accessibility on demand. In this research, an optimization based on genetic algorithms has been used to find the number of eVTOL vehicles which makes vehicle-to-grid services profitable for each of the electrical systems considered. This research discusses the impact that vehicle-to-grid eVTOL aircraft would cause, changing the current demand curve peaks and the economic benefits for eVTOL end users, power plant companies and system operator. The results show that there is an increase in the penetration of renewable energy sources, causing a reduction of approximately 4.6% in global emissions. In addition, the benefits obtained by the stakeholders considered in the system is greater than zero. The methodology considered in this research offers a new perspective for electrical systems to predict the demand of eVTOL aircraft, in specific territories, such as in the presented case study in the Archipelago of Canary Islands. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, there has been increasing interest in robotic solutions to revolutionize the conventional construction industry. Despite various advances in developing mobile robotic solutions for construction automation. One key bottleneck towards a fully automated robotic solution in construction is the initialization of the mobile robot. Currently, most of the commercialized mobile construction robots are manually initialized before autonomous navigation can be performed at the construction sites for automated tasks. Even if the robot is initialized, the location information can be lost while navigating and re-initialization is required to resume the navigation. Any wrong initialization can cause failure in robot pose tracking and thus prevent the robot from performing the planned tasks. However, in indoor construction sites, GPS is not accessible, and indoor infrastructures, such as beacon devices are not available for robot initialization. In addition, construction environments are dynamic with significant change in scenes and structures for different construction blocks and floors, making pre-scanning of the environments and map matching difficult and time-consuming. An infrastructure-free and environment-independent robot initialization method is therefore required. In this paper, we propose an integrated Building Information Model (BIM)-based indoor robot initialization system using an object detector to automatically initialize the mobile robot when it is deployed at an unknown location. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection technique is used to detect and locate the visual features, which are widely distributed building components at construction sites. A feature matching algorithm is developed to correlate the acquired online information of detected features with geometric and semantic information retrieved from BIM. The robot location in the BIM coordinate frame is then estimated based on the feature association. Moreover, the proposed system aggregates the BIM information and the sensory information to supervise the online robot decision making, making the entire system fully automatic. The proposed system is validated through experiments in various environments including a university building and ongoing construction sites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The COVID-19 lockdown has reduced public transportation service to the disadvantaged and disabled people who urgently need adequate mobility to obtain essential suppliers. This paper aims to improve the life quality of people with disabilities and elderly people by addressing social exclusion, accessibility, and mobility issues. Demand responsive transport services are frequently offered in the context of door-to-door transportation of the elderly and persons with disabilities. We study and compare two frameworks. We apply both Sample average approximation (SAA) and Rolling Horizon (RH) to optimize a car sharing system for the total cost, including initiation cost and operation cost after fleet size is determined. The model is implemented with given geographic conditions and other local information to be tailored for specific applications for local communities. Given that no historical data is available, random sample data is generated to simulate expected demands. We consider three types of probability distributions for daily demand data, and the results generated using three different distributions are being examined and compared. The research shows that the demand data following a normal distribution results in the minimum total cost. Additionally, we study the impact of several factors on total cost, including demand fulfillment rates and operation hours. Our results suggest that the impact of fulfillment rate on fleet size is exponential after a threshold under all three types of daily demand data, and extended operation hours can significantly reduce the total cost. Finally, the paper provides applicable frameworks for city planners, NPOs, and policymakers to better allocate limited resources to implement the carsharing system when little to no historical travel information is available for low-density population areas. It is anticipated that the outcome from this research would benefit disadvantaged and disabled travelers during COVID-19 or similar difficult situations in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Diverse physical features of urban areas alongside socio-demographic characteristics affect car ownership, and hence the daily mobility choices. As a case of sustainable mobility, we explore how various urban environments and socio-demographics associate with the spatial and social distribution of household car ownership and carlessness in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. Three urban fabrics characterizing the study area are established based on the transportation mode (walking, public transportation, or automobile) the physical urban environment primarily supports. The national level Monitoring System of Spatial Structure and Urban Form database, and the National Travel Survey (2016) are utilized to further include spatial and socio-demographic variables into our analysis across these fabrics. Our results show that households with and without cars differ in terms of residential distance to the city center, neighborhood density, house type, and socio-demographic profiles. Single pensioners and students are most likely to be carless, whereas families represent the opposite. Within the carless households the differences are also evident between different groups. For the more affluent households residing in dense and well-connected areas, and mostly possessing driver’s licenses, carlessness is presumably a choice. Contrarily, many other carless households represent the less affluent often located in the more distant, low-density, and less accessible areas, while also possessing less driver’s licenses, making carlessness more of a constraint, as the local urban fabric does not support such lifestyle. Consequently, carless households should be increasingly recognized as a focus group in sustainable urban planning in terms of identifiable best practices and potential vulnerability. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={A flight test of airborne gravimetry was conducted in Antarctic based on a strapdown inertial airborne gravimeter called SGA02 during the 36th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition. This test was aimed at evaluating accuracy of the system, collecting gravity data, and measuring the system’s practicability. Airborne gravimetry is one of the most significant methods in gathering gravity data with mGal-level precision over several kilometers of spatial resolution, which is a kind of strategic resource in the field of geophysics and many other important areas. A lack of southern hemisphere research and geophysical data exists due to the difficult accessibility of the Antarctic region. Since geophysical data of this region can hardly be acquired, the test performed in Antarctic can, in some degree, make up the gap between the gravity data and other geographic features. SGA02 is independently developed by NUDT (National University of Defense Technology), based on integrated SINS/DGPS system (strapdown inertial navigation system and differential global positioning system). In the flight test of the airborne gravimetry in the Antarctic region, SGA02 performed with 1.5 mGal precision (160s of filtering). The constitution of the whole system is introduced and the theory of the strapdown inertial airborne gravimeter is briefly discussed. The data gained from this test is displayed and analyzed, followed the discussion and evaluation of the results. © 2023 SPIE.},

abstract={In recent years, the concept of accessibility is receiving increased attention at political, scientific and social level. Furthermore, effectively handling accessibility issues and addressing the special needs of people with disabilities can provide a robust business environment and significant market exploitation opportunities. To that end, the need for accessibility, especially in urban environments, is vital and ICT can play a key role towards enhancing accessibility. Although digital geographic platforms like Google Maps or Bing Maps provide user-friendly interfaces for navigating through cities, they were designed with emphasis on the needs of motor vehicles and therefore information regarding pedestrian routes is still considered very limited. This paper reports on the development of an innovative platform called Seek & Go, which is a holistic aid application offering navigation services, especially designed for pedestrians with mobility problems and special accessibility requirements. A structured approach to the development of a pedestrian navigation data model that captures all required information is introduced. Finally, a pilot case is presented for the historical center of Thessaloniki. Copyright © 2023 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Investigating the spatial configuration can effectively interpret the circulation of an architectural plan layout. Student residences are among the most critical but neglected buildings in which the circulation system plays a vital role in efficient orientation and wayfinding. This study seeks to simulate and quantitatively assess the complexity of circulation spaces in student residence buildings in four different plan layouts. Space syntax analyses include the visual integration and connectivity drawn from Visibility Graph Analysis (VGA) maps for accessibility assessment, intelligibility calculated through all-line axial maps for wayfinding assessment, the field of view from the isovist map for visibility assessment, and agent-based analysis from the VGA map for the overall flow of occupants. Results revealed the strength and weaknesses of each layout. They indicated that the courtyard-shaped and figure-eight-shaped layouts could satisfy the highest degree of circulation efficiency. At the same time, the U-shaped and double-L-shaped plans had the weakest circulation. The study concludes by highlighting the practical implications for future strategies and the importance of syntactical analysis in the early stages of design. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The advent and popularity of shared electric scooters in many urban areas worldwide offer new opportunities and challenges to be addressed by the research community, especially as far as safety and accessibility issues are concerned. This paper proposes a methodology, based on geofencing technology (i.e., virtual geographic boundaries) to define in which urban areas the speed of shared electric scooters should be limited. The methodology also helps to prioritize the areas in which to enforce geofencing interventions. Historical patterns of the sharing system usage, crash databases and context/network-related parameters, together with expert judgment, are the main inputs for a geofencing optimization that provides the recommended clustered areas where the speed-limit geofencing scheme can be planned to assure the greater safety of the system. The methodology has been applied to a real case study, the city of Bari, Italy, to show the potential of the proposal. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become in the past decade an extremely at-tracting topic, also due to the increasing availability of affordable equipment and open-source control and pro-cessing software environments. This demand has also raised a strong interest in developing accessible experi-mental platforms to train engineering students in the rapidly evolving area of autonomous navigation. In this paper, we describe a platform based on low-cost off-the-shelf hardware that takes advantage of the Matlab/Sim-ulink programming environment to tackle most of the problems related to UAV autonomous navigation. More specifically, the subject of this paper is the autonomous control of the flight of a small UAV, which must explore and patrol an indoor unknown environment. Objectives: to analyse the existing hardware platforms for autono-mous flight indoors, choose a flight exploration scenario of unknown premises, to formalize the procedure for obtaining a model of knowledge for semantic classification of premises, to formalize obtaining distance to ob-stacles using data camera horizontally employment and building on its barrier map. Namely, we use the method of image segmentation based on the brightness threshold, a method of training the semantic segmentation net-work, and computer algorithms in probabilistic robotics for mobile robots. We consider both the case of navi-gation guided by structural visual information placed in the environment, e.g., contrast markers for flight (such as path marked by a red tape), and the case of navigation based on unstructured information such as recogniza-ble objects or human gestures. Basing on preliminary tests, the most suitable method for autonomous in-door navigation is by using\ object classification and segmentation, so that the UAV gradually analyses the surround-ing objects in the room and makes decisions on path planning. The result of our investigation is a method that is suitable to allow the autonomous flight of a UAV with a frontal video camera. Conclusions. The scientific novelty of the obtained results is as follows: we have improved the method of autonomous flight of small UAVs by using the semantic network model and determining the purpose of flight only at a given altitude to minimize the computational costs of limited autopilot capabilities for low-cost small UAV models. The results of our study can be further extended by means of a campaign of experiments in different environments © David Naso, Olha Pohudina, Serhij Yashin, Andrii Pohudin, Rossella Bartolo, 2023},

abstract={Spatial fragmentation and congestion have become increasingly apparent in cities, also due to the functional specialization of open spaces. Such phenomena also affect the accessibility of the public realm and therefore urban liveability. With this in mind, it seems necessary to turn public open spaces into dynamic and flexible places that can induce wellbeing and develop a shared identity. Urban open spaces that relate to hospitals and universities play a double role in terms of the specific functions of care, research, learning, innovation, and the overall liveability of the city in which they provide collective services. The ongoing “Careggi Campus” research deals with the case study of Florence University-Hospital as an important part of the broader urban network of public open spaces. In this complex, over twenty thousand people per day use the fragmented and cluttered open spaces, which clearly fall short when it comes to accessibility and liveability. The research aims to produce a landscape masterplan focused on transitioning from a street-based model of mobility and accessibility towards a people-based network of liveable places. In this context, accessibility is a complex driving criterion for landscape design to investigate how the hospital’s open spaces could perform as a high quality network and sustain health by providing wellbeing and fostering lifestyles changes. A main topic of research is how this collective system can host the existing wide variety of permanent functions and spontaneous uses without creating conflict and dysfunction. As the new Urban Sustainable Mobility Plan promotes an innovative vision for public transport, active mobility and intermodal parking lots, rethinking hierarchies between the active mobility of vehicles and people within the University-Hospital could lead to a sustainable transformation of its landscape. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Owing to the ubiquity of cellular communication signals, positioning with the fifth-generation (5G) signal has emerged as a promising solution in global navigation satellite system-denied areas. Unfortunately, although the widely employed antenna arrays in 5G remote radio units (RRUs) facilitate the measurement of the direction of arrival (DOA), DOA-based positioning performance is severely degraded by array errors. This article proposes an in situ calibration framework with a user terminal (UT) transmitting 5G reference signals at several known positions in the actual operating environment and the accessible RRUs estimating their array errors from these reference signals. Further, since sub-6 GHz small-cell RRUs deployed for indoor coverage generally have small-aperture antenna arrays, while 5G signals have plentiful bandwidth resources, this work segregates the multipath components via super-resolution delay estimation based on the maximum likelihood criteria. This differs significantly from existing in situ calibration works which resolve multipaths in the spatial domain. The superiority of the proposed method is first verified by numerical simulations. We then demonstrate via field test with commercial 5G equipment that, a reduction of 46.7% for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$1{\text -}\sigma$</tex-math> </inline-formula> DOA estimation error can be achieved by in situ calibration using the proposed method.

abstract={This paper describes a study, which is currently underway, whose aim is to investigate how the haptic channel can be effectively exploited by visually impaired users in a mobile app for the preliminary exploration of an indoor environment, namely a shopping mall. Our goal was to use haptics to convey knowledge of how the points of interest (POIs) are distributed within the physical space, and at the same time provide information about the function of each POI, so that users can get a perception of how functional areas are distributed in the environment “at a glance”. Shopping malls are typical indoor environments in which orientation aids are highly appreciated by customers, and many different functional areas persist. We identified seven typical categories of POIs which can be encountered in a mall, and then associated a different vibration pattern each. In order to validate our approach, we designed and developed a prototype for preliminary testing, based on the Android platform. The prototype was periodically debugged with the aid of two visually impaired experienced users, who gave us precious advice throughout the development process. We will describe how this app was conceived, the issues emerged during its development and the positive outcomes produced by a very early testing stage. Finally, we will show that the proposed approach is promising and is worthy of further investigation. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Three-dimensional (3D) maps are used extensively in a variety of applications, from air and noise pollution modelling to location-based services such as 3D mapping-aided Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and positioning and navigation for emergency service personnel, unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous vehicles. However, the financial cost associated with creating and updating 3D maps using the current state-of-the-art methods such as laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry are prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, researchers have proposed using GNSS signals to create 3D maps. This paper advances that family of methods by proposing and implementing a novel technique that avoids the difficult step of directly classifying GNSS signals into line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight classes by utilising edge detection techniques adapted from computer vision. This prevents classification biases and increases the range of environments in which GNSS-based 3D mapping methods can be accurately deployed. Being based on the patterns of blockage and attenuation of GNSS signals that are freely and globally available to receive by many mobile phones, makes the proposed technique a free, scalable and accessible solution. This paper also identifies some key indicators affecting data collection scalability and efficiency of the 3D mapping solution. © 2023 The Author(s).

abstract={Cities have been developed to support cars rather than people. This has led to a decrease in people's ability to move, live and interact with their urban surroundings., thus affecting the quality-of-life. Obviously., this applies to all of us, especially to people suffering from impairments. Surprisingly, the lack of information is one of the main obstacles to the construction of services that could bridge the gap between people living in urban areas and their environment. Take Google Maps as an example; one can request a route between any two destinations and will surely be provided with the shortest path, whether traveling by car, public transportation, or on foot. However, there are no pathways or information available to help visually impaired people. In response to the above issue, in this paper, we discuss how the widespread presence of sensor-equipped smartphones can be harnessed to create innovative services capable of improving factors such as interaction with the environment, social inclusion, and quality of life. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={The concept of smart cities is to enhance the life quality of residents and provide efficient services by integrating advanced information and communication technologies, autonomous robots, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, etc. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a class of autonomous flying mobile robots that bring a lot of benefits to smart cities due to their mobility, accessibility, autonomy, and many other advantages. Their integration allows for accomplishing hard and complex tasks that humans or other entities are not able to complete. In most applications, multiple connected UAVs are required to build a network under which missions are completed and tasks are shared. This network can be established by finding the optimal UAV placement that meets some requirements such as user coverage, UAV connectivity, energy, and load distribution. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm, called IMRFO-TS, based on the hybridization of Improved Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (IMRFO) with the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm for solving the UAV placement problem in a smart city. First, the tangential control strategy is incorporated into the original MRFO algorithm to enhance its convergence speed and explore the search space effectively. Second, The TS algorithm is hybridized with the IMRFO algorithm to increase the exploitation capability of IMRFO and improve the best solution (placement quality) obtained after each iteration. The performance of the proposed IMRFO-TS algorithm is validated using 52 benchmarks considering the fitness value, coverage, connectivity, energy consumption, and load distribution parameters. Compared to eight well-known optimization meta-heuristics such as the original MRFO, TS algorithm, Bat Algorithm (BA), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA), the results of the experiments revealed the significant superiority of the proposed IMRFO-TS algorithm by obtaining promising solutions (optimal positions of UAVs) in the majority of the cases. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Semantically rich depiction of the concepts for context-aware indoor routing brings appealing benefits for the safety of occupants of smart spaces in emergency evacuation. In this paper, we propose Smart Building Evacuation Ontology (SBEO3), a reusable ontology for indoor spaces, based on three different data models: user, building, and context. We provide a common representation of indoor routing and navigation, describe users’ characteristics and preferences, grouping of individuals and their role in a specific context, hazards, and emergency evacu-ation. Among other characteristics, we consider abilities of individuals, safety and accessibility of spaces related to each person, intensity, impact, and severity of an emergency event or activity. SBEO is flexible and compatible with other ontologies of its domain, including SEAS, SSN/SOSA, SEMA4A, and empathi. We evalu-ate SBEO based on several metrics demonstrating that it addresses the information needs for the context-aware route recommendation system for emergency evacuation in indoor spaces. In the end, a simulation-based application example exploits SBEO using Context-Aware Emergency Evacuation Software (CAREE)4. © 2023, ComSIS Consortium. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Orientation and mobility apps for visually impaired people are well known to be effective in improving the quality of life for this target group. A mobile application that guides a visually impaired person step-by-step through a physical space is a valuable aid, but it does not provide an overview of a complex environment "at a glance," as a traditional hard-copy tactile map does. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a smartphone GPS map, enriched with haptic and audio hints, can facilitate cognitive mapping for visually impaired users. Encouraged by a preliminary study conducted in co-operation with two visually impaired volunteers, we designed and developed an Android prototype for exploration of an urban area. Our goal was to provide an affordable, portable and versatile solution to help users increase awareness of an environment through the positions of its landmarks and points of interest. Vibro-tactile and audio hints were linked to the coordinates on the map via the GeoJSON data format and were issued exploiting the text-to-speech and vibration features of the mobile device, as they were displayed through the operating system's APIs. Test sessions and interviews with visually impaired users produced encouraging results. Results, to be verified by more extensive testing, overall confirm the validity of our approach and are in line with results found in the literature. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Introduction: Shared dockless electric scooters (e-scooters) are a popular shared mobility service providing an accessible last-mile transportation option in urban and campus environments. However, city and campus stakeholders may hesitate to introduce these scooters due to safety concerns. While prior e-scooter safety studies have collected injury data from hospitals or riding data under controlled or naturalistic conditions, these datasets are limited and did not identify risk factors associated with e-scooter riding safety. To address this gap in e-scooter safety research, this study collected the largest naturalistic e-scooter dataset to date and quantified the safety risks associated with behavioral, infrastructure, and environmental factors. Method: A fleet of 200 e-scooters was deployed on Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, VA for a 6-month period. Fifty were equipped with a unique onboard data acquisition system, using sensors and video to capture e-scooter trips in their entirety. The resulting dataset consisted of 3,500 hours of data spanning over 8,500 trips. Algorithms were developed to identify safety critical events (SCEs) in the dataset and analyses were conducted to determine the prevalence of various SCE risk factors and associated odds ratios. Results: Results from this study indicate that infrastructure-related factors, behavior of e-scooter riders and other actors, and environmental factors all contributed to the SCE risk for e-scooter riders in Virginia Tech's pedestrian-dense campus environment. Conclusions: To help mitigate unsafe rider behavior, educational outreach programs should quantify the significant risks associated with infrastructure, behavioral, and environmental risk factors and provide clear recommendations to riders. Improved infrastructure maintenance and design may also improve safety for e-scooter riders. Practical Applications: The infrastructure, behavioral, and environmental risk factors quantified in this study can be applied by e-scooter service providers, municipalities, and campus administrators to develop mitigation strategies to reduce the safety risks associated with e-scooter deployments in the future. © 2023},

abstract={A vital mode of transportation for short term mobility is paratransit. There are several studies on paratransit safety in developed nations but the developing nations like Bangladesh pay less attention to the issue. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of paratransit using the perceptions of riders and drivers. Negative binomial model (NBM) was used to calibrate the safety of paratransit using 451 responses in Chittagong city. The study's findings highlight the significance of perceptions of travel safety in enhancing accessibility during the routine travel. Vehicle speed limits (km/h), which reduce the chance of accidents and having an institutional driver's license are among the variables that have emerged for the betterment of safety. Therefore, identifying factors that can makes these transportation systems safer will allow service managers and controllers to optimize passenger and driver safety. © 2023 UNIVERSITY OF ZILINA.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the potential role of the Emergency Department (ED) layout in enhancing its functionality. It applies a performance-based building design (PBBD) approach to evaluate emergency department functionality and efficiency as the most important criterion behind the success of the hospital service. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach based on space syntax theory was adopted through four syntactic maps (isovist, axial, convex, and visibility graph analysis VGA), to depict three case studies in Erbil city hospitals by analyzing three different layout typologies of ED such as Podular, Ballroom and Linear through measuring wayfinding, accessibility, privacy, visibility, time spend-length of stay and corridor circulation as layout factors. Findings: This paper provides empirical insights on how the ED layout typology factors significantly affect producing functionally efficient EDs, whereas the Ballroom ED layout typology is the most effective compared to others. Given the importance of ED in enhancing a healthy environment for patients and staff, study findings are valuable resource for health designers, who play a critical role in ensuring patients enjoy a healthy and safe environment. Originality/value: This paper has attempted to identify the appropriate layout of ED for effective functional performance in hospitals. A syntactical analysis between three different ED layout typologies based on the layout variables has been analysed using the PBBD approach. There has been no attempt carried out so far to analyse the functional performance of the PBBD approach in different ED layouts using layout variables. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Car ownership has been the object of interest in various research areas. Studies on the topic focus especially on the influence of factors such as environment, life, family events, use, and availability, usually restricted to a given city or region. This paper focuses on recent studies that identified enablers, barriers, and trends related to car ownership in the automotive sector. We use an exploratory-qualitative approach based on systematic mapping of the literature to select papers published between 2019 and March 2021 on the Scopus database. As a result, we first classified the factors that act as enablers or barriers to the acquisition and maintenance of cars. These factors were divided into the following six groups: personal, cultural, political, economic, technological, and environmental. Next, we identified car-ownership-related trends for the automotive sector: purchase replaced by effective use; restrictions on car ownership; autonomous driving; sustainable mobility; new mobility models; customized customer service; real-time integrated modal communication, systematic global traffic, and integrated urban planning. We consider our findings to be relevant contributions to the industry in relation to establishing strategies and public administrators acting in the transportation planning field. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022.},

abstract={Taxi-sharing is a known solution for reducing congestion and is more beneficial when the traveled miles, imposed by detours while serving additional passengers, are minimized. This study proposes incorporation of alternative meeting points in taxisharing routes to boost the efficiency of the system by eliminating unnecessary detours and improving the chances of passengers being matched. Unlike most ridesharing systems, in the proposed approach, passengers are not necessarily picked up or dropped off at their original location, but at a walkable distance from their origin. The proposed framework deals with practical challenges of including meeting points in a real-world high-demand taxi-sharing system with hundreds of requests per minute. This includes efficient selection of alternative pick up locations and incorporation of these alternatives into a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to find the optimal schedule. Using the 2015 New York City (NYC) yellow cab dataset, first, the potential benefits of introducing meeting points in Manhattan road network are demonstrated. Given the Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Hard (NP-hard) nature of the associated optimization problem, the problem is then broken down into smaller-sized problems forming clusters of passengers with high potential of sharing a ride. Then, the proposed MILP model is used to find the optimal route for each cluster, while selecting the best pickup point for each passenger. Testing on a sample of the NYC dataset, it is shown that the proposed methodology improves the efficiency of the taxi-sharing system by reducing the wait times by about 50% while considerably reducing total travel times and the number of vehicles used. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022.},

abstract={In Ukrainian cities, the number of users of bicycles, usual and electric scooters, and e-unicycles increased in recent years. All these vehicles are a direct alternative to walking trips or short-distance transport trips. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the micromobility has become a safe option to travel in the open air which ensured the possibility to keep social distance and reduce the number of contacts in comparison with public transport. This paper presents the approach to defining the rational number and location of e-scooter sharing stations under limited data. To estimate the number of the sharing stations, the station capacity, potential daily demand for e-scooter trips and the locations of available e-scooters were used. The locations of sharing stations were defined concerning walking accessibility, demand coverage and remoteness from the shortest path of the vehicle commissioned to collect the scooters for recharging or replace the scooter batteries on-site. The research was conducted by the example of Sobornyi district in Dnipro, Ukraine. Apart from the number and location of sharing stations, the potential flows of e-scooter riders were modeled. These findings are relevant because they can provide local authorities and sharing operators with the information for well-grounded decisions on public space and street design, micromobility infrastructure extension as well as planning of the sharing system performance indicators. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the journey using public transport, accessibility of transit becomes equally important as mobility. Available mobility modes become successful only when they perform well in accessibility too. The objectives of this study are, by means of geoprocessing techniques, to prepare an accessibility index and use it to evaluate the suitability of the public transport network offered to the various zones and economically active areas present in the municipal area of Surat city. The proposed accessibility index aims to assess the quality of the public transport structure offered regarding its connectivity to different locations and jobs as well as the ease (or difficulty) of access to different public transport modes. The results indicate that the public transport system is effective as an instrument for serving more than the average amount of accessibility to the population but does not show a better range of reachability to higher economically active areas. This tendency can be explained by the higher quality of public transport is experienced in the central and western regions and lower performance in the peripheral areas of the city. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In this study, we uniformly partition an empirical vehicular network map and determine the locations where electric vehicle (EV) charging stations will be deployed by implementing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The optimal placements utilize the spatiotemporal taxi movements representing energy demands. From each partition, the taxi GPS coordinates are extracted and used to obtain the global best location of the charging station. Parameters such as the total number of taxis accessible to each deployed EV charging station and the average distance of each taxi from all the charging stations have also been computed to evaluate the deployment method. Results have shown that the total number of taxis within the 1-km radius distance of each EV charging station ranges from 797 to 1218 taxis, while the average distance of each taxi from all of the charging stations ranges from 3.14 to 4.46 km. We also note that there is a small inter-distance separation among all charging stations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Compact settlements take advantage of economies of scale by sustaining a system of high-quality socio-economic services at close proximities. Urban density with a balanced mix of uses also benefits walking and cycling as mobility modes that provide sufficient access to urban amenities, especially when combined with effective public transport. Indeed, walking and cycling can decrease the use of cars for short-distance trips. From this perspective, urban density can help to reduce pollution, optimise energy consumption and decrease infrastructural expenditures while contributing to more attractive urban environments. These ideas have induced a new wave of time geography planning concepts, such as the ‘10-minute city’, to enhance urban sustainability. For these concepts to move beyond visionary narratives, they must be expressed in specific empirical frameworks. Thus, the current research focuses on accessibility to grocery shops, as an essential urban service, in the Stavanger metropolitan area (Norway) using 10 minutes isochrones for walking and cycling. The study integrates open data, GIS network analyses, statistical regressions and bivariate representations of the results. The research estimates the level of serviceability by quantifying the number of shops that are accessible for each location and interrelates this estimation with spatial and population densities. The paper also presents a method to detect spatial inequalities by visualising over/under-serviced areas. This visualisation can become a tool to support strategies to rebalance such imbalances. Moreover, this study offers a practical approach towards the ‘10-minute city’ concept, as it can be adjusted to different isochrones at different spatial scales. In general, this approach can serve both to analyse existing contexts and to model strategies to support sustainability policies, such as urban densification and the promotion of environmental-friendly transport. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={This study evaluates the critical success factors for smart mobility systems (SM) and assesses its current application level for smart city development using Nigerian as a case study. This study is based on a mixed-method approach (Delphi and quantitative survey). The study revealed seven critical success factors of smart mobility. Furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that factors like sustainable, innovative and safe transportation system, availability of ICT infrastructure, local accessibility of transportation infrastructure, availability of transportation infrastructure (bike, cycling, pedestrian mobility facilities), are the most significant smart mobility success factors. Also, a good consensus was achieved for all the success factors. The Mann Whitney test from the final Delphi result revealed no significant difference in the responses of the two groups of experts. Assessing the level of application of the smart mobility success factors revealed an abysmal application level according to the expert's opinion. This study contributes to the body of knowledge as it reveals the SM success factors that should be considered to achieve a sustainable smart mobility system in a city. The findings of this study will assist cities worldwide in developing smart mobility systems and further improve their competitive advantage. The study concludes that the evaluated success factors are significant in smart mobility systems development and application, based on expert's opinion. However, its level of adoption and application is still low in Nigeria. Therefore, it is recommended that the government and policy decision-makers in urban transportation infrastructure development should use the results from this study, as a scorecard to know lagging areas and factors that need significant improvement and application to achieve a smart mobility system. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Existing wheelchair (WC) designs lack independent toilet accessibility, transferability and indoor manoeuvrability combined in a WC. In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed. Materials and method: A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results: The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access. Conclusion: The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.Implications for rehabilitation The expected outcomes and implications of the current commode WC project with regard to rehabilitation purpose are enlisted below: In the present scenario, a WC user is heavily dependent on external assistance to access private spaces in general and toilets in particular. The introduced model is capable to address this shortcoming by enabling the user to access the toilet utility directly by self propelling. Indeed, for a person with locomotor disability, a WC is the natural extension of his physical body. Thereby, this multipurpose commode WC design offers much Independence and greater flexibility to the indoor movements. The proposed design instils confidence to a WC user to access and transfer between facilities by means of self effort. Consequently it is expected to improve the quality of one’s personal life significantly. Importantly, this is an open-source project, those who are interested in rehabilitation motives can modify the present design to suit their local requirements especially in resource-limited settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
