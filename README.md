# accessible-wayfinding-systematic-review-data

Data for a systematic review of accessible wayfinding and navigation, conducted using as described in Section 3 of [Prandi et al.'s "Accesible wayfinding and navigation: a systematic mapping study"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-021-00843-x) (Research question: "Which devices and software applications for accessible wayfinding and navigation have been proposed in scientific literature?"), but updated for post-2021. Search conducted May 24, 2023 using Scopus (access provided by UNC Chapel Hill Libraries).

## Paper Search Criteria

*Search string:* (accessible OR accessibility) AND (city OR indoor OR urban OR campus OR university) AND (wayfinding OR navigation OR mobility) AND (application OR system OR map)

*Scopus subjects:* "Computer Science", "Engineering"

*Publication time range:* 2021, 2022 (2023 is analyzed separately)

## Exclusion Criteria

### Stage 1

*Aspects analyzed:* Title, abstract, paper type

*Exclusion criteria:* Off-topic, duplicates, introductory papers to conference/workshop proceedings, non-English language

- Note: While Prandi et al. do not consider papers not written in English, this repository briefly examines Spanish-language papers from 2010 to 2023 separately, albeit limited by the English-language focus of Scopus.

### Stage 2

*Aspects analyzed:* Title, abstract, paper type, paper text

*Exclusion criteria:* Preliminary work, extended abstract, requirement analysis (versus actual application), systems for data collection and storage, conceptual model, user study or guidelines, survey/review

- Note: survey/reviews are analyzed separately.
